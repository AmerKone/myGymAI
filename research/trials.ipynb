As early as 2000 b.c.e., the \\nancient Egyptians lifted sacks of sand to strength-\\ntrain for hunting and military duty. According to \\nmilitary records, the Chinese also used strength \\ntraining for their military personnel as early as \\n700 b.c.e. But the historical association that most \\npeople are familiar with is the ancient Greeks. \\nMany of the athletes who competed in the ancient \\nOlympics lifted heavy stones to develop strength \\nand boost their athletic performance. Besides \\nthose functional results, strength training provided \\nthe development of a muscular physique. This \\nmasculine physique was honored in classic Greek \\nart and writing. In fact, it may be the ancient Greek \\nculture’s celebration of muscle that is responsible \\nfor spawning the modern sport of bodybuilding. \\nSeveral famous athletes during that period, such \\nas Milo and Heracles, often performed feats of \\nstrength and displayed their muscularity to spec-\\ntators. In the 19th century, the appreciation by \\nthe masses for heavily muscled physiques made \\ncelebrities out of many performing strongmen of \\nthat time. The most famous was Eugen Sandow, \\nwho is considered the father of bodybuilding.\\nDespite the fact that humans have a longstand-\\ning fascination with strength and muscularity, the \\nconcept of strength training is one that few have \\nfamiliarized themselves with. Even during the \\nfitness boom of the 1970s in the United States, \\nmost Americans participated in some form of \\naerobic exercise but neglected the strength com-\\nponent of physical fitness. Over the years, with \\nhelp from pioneers of strength training (such as \\nBob Hoffman, Joe Weider, and Charles Atlas) and \\nthrough advances in research on the developing \\nscience of resistance training, strength became \\nviewed as a necessary component of physical fit-\\nness and athletic performance. And participation \\nin strength training grew faster than participation \\nin any other physical activity.\\nAs the popularity of strength training grew, so \\ndid awareness that this practice was a complicated \\nscience that participants must fully understand in \\norder to reap the true benefits. That is why part I \\nof this book is so important for anyone interested \\nin strength training at any level. Unless you clearly \\nunderstand the principles of strength training, you \\nwill never fully comprehend how to implement an \\neffective strength training program.\\nSo before you skip ahead to one of the strength \\ntraining programs in parts II, III, and IV , be sure \\nyou have a decent grasp of the fundamentals \\npresented in these first four chapters. Armed \\nwith this background, you will have a much fuller \\nunderstanding of the exercises, techniques, and \\nprograms presented in the other chapters. You \\nalso will be more capable of individualizing these \\ntechniques to create specialized programs for \\nyourself and for others.'),\n",

Most are interested \\nin gaining muscle strength and muscle mass with \\na concomitant loss of body fat. In addition, many \\npeople expect these physical adaptations to carry \\nover into improvements in performance of athletic \\nendeavors and daily life activities. Strength train-\\ning can provide these adaptations as long as you \\nfollow certain principles, which are discussed here \\nto help you realize your strength training goals. \\nThese principles are integral to understanding how \\nstrength training works, how to individualize it to \\nmeet your needs and goals, and how to change it \\nto continue making adaptations as you progress.\\nIn addition to understanding the concepts of \\nstrength training, you must be familiar with the \\nterminology that is often used in discussions of \\nstrength training. Having the ability to understand \\nand use this lexicon will help you to learn the fun-\\ndamentals of strength training and to communicate \\nwith others who participate in strength training. To \\nfamiliarize yourself with this vocabulary, refer to \\nthe glossary at the end of this book.\\nBefore we can discuss the principles of strength \\ntraining, we must define the major terms that will \\nbe discussed throughout this book. First and fore-\\nmost is the actual term \\nstrength training. If you’ve \\ndone a fair share of reading on the topic of strength \\ntraining—be it on the Internet, in magazines, or \\nin other books—you’ve probably discovered that \\nthe terms \\nstrength training,\\xa0weight training, and \\nresistance training are often used interchangeably. \\nWhile there are definite similarities in the three \\nterms, a more precise interpretation of the defini-\\ntions points out the differences. Resistance train-\\ning is the broadest of the three terms. It describes \\nany type of training in which the body must move \\nin some direction against some type of force that \\nresists that movement. This could include lifting \\nfree weights, pushing against a hydraulic appara-\\ntus, or running up a set of stairs. \\nStrength training \\nis a type of resistance training (although not all \\ntypes of resistance training are strength training). \\nSpecifically, strength training refers to any type \\nof training that involves the body moving in some \\ndirection against a force that specifically induces \\nchanges in muscle strength or hypertrophy (muscle \\ngrowth). This could include lifting free weights or \\nmoving against a hydraulic apparatus, but not \\nrunning up a set of stairs. \\nWeight training is also \\na type of resistance training and can be a type of \\nstrength training. By strict terms of its definition, \\nit refers to any type of training in which the body \\nmoves in some direction against a force that \\nresists that movement and is supplied by some \\ntype of weight. This could include free weights and \\nweight machines but not training with a hydraulic \\napparatus or running up a set of stairs. See table \\n1.1 for a list of training methods that are catego-\\nrized under each of these types of training.\\nThis book covers strength training (most of it will \\nbe weight training), because it best describes the \\ntypes of training that we are interested in—exer -\\ncise that involves the body moving against a force \\nin an effort to induce changes in muscle strength \\nor hypertrophy.'),\n",

But defining strength is not \\nthat simple. That’s because strength has many \\nmanifestations. The following definitions are all \\nforms of strength.\\nabsolute strength—The maximal amount of force \\na muscle can produce when all inhibitory and \\nprotective mechanisms are removed. Because \\nof this, it is rare that a person could ever demon-\\nstrate his or her \\nabsolute strength. This can \\ntake place only under extreme measures such \\nas during an emergency, under hypnosis, or with \\ncertain ergogenic aids.\\nmaximal strength—The maximal amount of force \\na muscle or muscle groups can produce in a \\nspecific exercise for one repetition. This is also \\nreferred to as \\none-repetition maximum, or 1RM. \\nSome estimate that the 1RM usually amounts \\nto only about 80 percent of absolute strength. \\nThis type of strength is important for powerlifters.\\nrelative strength—The ratio between a person’s \\nmaximal strength and his or her body weight. \\nThis is important when comparing the strength \\nof athletes who are much different in body size. \\nRelative strength is determined by dividing the \\n1RM by the body weight of the person. For \\nexample, a 200-pound (91-kilogram) athlete who \\ncan bench-press 400 pounds (400 ÷ 200 = 2) \\nhas the same relative strength as a 100-pound \\n(45-kilogram) athlete who can bench-press 200 \\npounds (200 ÷ 100 = 2). This type of strength is \\nimportant for powerlifters as well as for football \\nplayers and other strength athletes who are often \\ncompared with other teammates as a means of \\npredicting performance on the field.\\nspeed strength—The ability to move the body or \\nan object quickly. This term is more commonly \\nknown as \\npower. This type of strength is import-\\nant for most sports but is most critical in track \\nand field events such as the shot put, javelin, \\nand long jump.\\nstarting strength—The ability to generate a sharp \\nrise in power during the initial phase of the \\nmovement. This type of strength is important in \\nOlympic weightlifting, deadlifts, boxing, martial \\narts, and offensive line positions in football, \\nwhere strength must be generated immediately.\\nacceleration strength—The ability to continue the \\nsharp rise in power throughout most of the move-\\nment of the exercise. This type of strength takes \\nover after starting strength and is important for \\nsports such as judo, wrestling, and sprinting.\\nendurance strength—The ability to maintain force \\nproduction for a longer time or through multiple \\nrepetitions of an exercise. This type of strength \\nis important in wrestling, cycling, swimming, and \\ntraining for bodybuilding.\\nTABLE 1.1 Categories and Methods of Training\\nType of training Sample training methods\\nResistance training Free weights (including common objects)\\nWeight machines (linear guided, cable or pulley system, cam based)\\nHydraulic machines\\nPneumatic machines\\nIsokinetic machines\\nBody-weight training\\nSled dragging\\nParachute running\\nStrength training Free weights (including common objects)\\nWeight machines (linear guided, cable or pulley system, cam based)\\nHydraulic machines\\nPneumatic machines\\nBody-weight training\\nWeight training Free weights (including common objects)\\nWeight machines (linear guided, cable or pulley system, cam based)\\nwww.ebook777.com'),\n",

Each of \\nthese types of strength is developed with the use \\nof resistance of some type, be it free weights, \\nmachines, or body weight. Although this book \\nfocuses on strength training for muscle mass and \\nstrength, as well as fat loss, other muscle adap-\\ntations can take place with the use of strength \\ntraining.\\nTYPES OF MUSCLE ACTION\\nDuring a typical strength training session, muscles \\nmay contract from tens to hundreds of times to \\nmove the body or the implement they are training \\nwith. Neural stimulation of the muscle causes \\nthe contractile units of the muscle to attempt to \\nshorten. But contraction does not always involve \\nshortening of the muscle fibers. Depending on \\nthe load and the amount of force supplied by the \\nmuscle, three different muscle actions may occur \\nduring a muscle contraction (see figure 1.1):\\n1. Concentric muscle action.  This type of \\nmuscle action occurs when the muscle \\nforce exceeds the external resistance, \\nresulting in joint movement as the muscle \\nshortens. In other words, concentric con-\\ntractions are those in which the muscle \\nfibers shorten while contracting to lift the \\nweight. This is demonstrated by the upward \\nphase of a biceps curl and is often referred \\nto as the positive phase of the repetition.\\n2. Eccentric muscle action. This type of muscle \\naction occurs when the external resistance \\nexceeds the force supplied by the muscle, \\nresulting in joint movement as the muscle \\nlengthens. Eccentric muscle actions are \\ndemonstrated by the downward phase of \\nthe biceps curl. This is often referred to as \\nthe negative portion of the repetition. Even \\nthough the fibers are lengthening, they’re \\nalso in a state of contraction, permitting \\nthe weight to return to the starting position \\nin a controlled manner.\\n3. Isometric muscle action.  This type of \\nmuscle action occurs when the muscle \\ncontracts without moving, generating force \\nwhile its length remains static . Isometric \\nmuscle actions are demonstrated in an \\nattempt to lift an immovable object or \\nan object that is too heavy to move. The \\nmuscle fibers contract in an attempt to \\nmove the weight, but the muscle does \\nnot shorten in overall length because the \\nobject is too heavy to move.\\nEccentric:\\nmuscle lengthens\\nIsometric:\\nmuscle length\\nis unchanged\\nConcentric:\\nmuscle shortens\\nFIGURE 1.1  Major types of muscle actions: concentric, \\nisometric, and eccentric.\\nAmong strength training scientists there is much \\ndebate about the importance of each of these \\ntypes of muscle actions regarding increases in \\nstrength and muscle mass. Studies have been con-\\nducted in an effort to determine whether one type \\nof muscle action is most important for enhancing \\nmuscle strength and mass. Because it is possible \\nto produce greater force during eccentric and iso-\\nmetric muscle actions as compared to concentric \\nmuscle actions, it has been hypothesized that \\nthese muscle actions may be more important than \\nconcentric muscle actions for inducing changes in \\nmuscle strength and size.\\nResearchers have found that training with \\nisometric muscle actions can increase muscle \\nstrength and size (Fleck and Schutt 1985). How-\\never, the strength gains from isometric training \\nare realized only during the specific joint angles at \\nwhich the muscles were trained. In other words, if \\nsomeone trains isometrically on the bench press \\nat the point halfway between the start and finish,'),\n",

This would not \\nequate to greater overall strength in the bench \\npress unless a variety of joint angles between the \\nstart and finish were also trained isometrically. \\nTherefore, while isometric training can be bene -\\nficial, concentric and eccentric muscle actions \\nshould also be included for better overall muscle \\nadaptations. For a sample training program that \\nuses isometric muscle actions, see Static Strength \\nTraining in chapter 9.\\nBecause it is possible to overload a muscle \\nmore during eccentric muscle contractions, these \\ncontractions cause more muscle damage. It has \\nbeen hypothesized that this greater overload can \\ninduce greater gains in strength. Indeed, research \\nhas shown that eccentric-only training does induce \\nsignificant strength gains; however, this training \\nappears to offer no greater strength benefit than \\nconcentric-only training. Therefore, to maximize \\nmuscle adaptations, strength training programs \\nneed to incorporate both concentric and eccentric \\nmuscle actions. For sample training programs that \\nincorporate eccentric training, see Negative Rep -\\netitions in chapter 6 and Negative-Rep Strength \\nTraining in chapter 9.\\nThe use of concentric, eccentric, and isometric \\nmuscle actions in strength training will yield some-\\nwhat different adaptations. Although isometric \\nmuscle actions can improve strength and muscle \\nsize to some degree, they provide mainly static \\nstrength. This does not necessarily carry over to \\ndynamic strength used for most sports. Therefore, \\nmost strength training programs should focus on \\nconcentric and eccentric muscle actions. Greater \\nimprovements in strength and muscle mass can be \\nachieved when repetitions include both concentric \\nand eccentric muscle actions.\\nAnother type of muscle action that should \\nbe considered here is called \\nvoluntary maximal \\nmuscle action. This type of muscle action does \\nnot refer to the actual movement of the muscle \\nbut to the intensity of the resistance. When a \\nmuscle undergoes a voluntary maximal muscle \\naction, it is moving against as much resistance \\nas its current fatigue level will allow. Regardless \\nof how many repetitions are performed in a set—\\nwhether it be 1 or 10—it is the last repetition, \\nwhen momentary concentric muscle failure is \\nreached, that is considered the voluntary maximal \\nmuscle action. In other words, not another single \\nrepetition can be performed. This is also referred \\nto as the \\nrepetition maximum\\xa0(RM) and is usually \\nrepresented with a number preceding the RM. \\nFor example, 1RM would represent the amount of \\nweight that induces a voluntary maximal muscle \\naction with one repetition. A 10RM is the amount \\nof weight that induces a voluntary maximal muscle \\naction on the 10th repetition.\\nPRINCIPLES OF STRENGTH \\nTRAINING\\nCountless principles of strength training are being \\nemployed today. But the validity of many of these \\nprinciples is questionable, because few strength \\ntraining professionals agree on the majority of \\nthem. However, there are a few principles that are \\nrevered by all strength training professionals: the \\nprinciple of specificity, the principle of progressive \\noverload, the principle of individuality, the principle \\nof variation, the principle of maintenance, and the \\nprinciple of reversibility. So important are these \\nprinciples that few would argue against their being \\nconsidered laws of strength training.\\nprinciple of specificity—One of the seminal prin -\\nciples in designing strength training programs. \\nIt is often referred to as SAID, which stands for \\n“specific adaptation to imposed demands.” In \\nits most basic definition, it means to train in a \\nspecific manner to produce a specific outcome. \\nFor instance, if the immediate goal is to increase \\n1RM strength, then training with the appropriate \\nrange of repetition, proper rest periods, and \\napposite frequency to optimize strength gains is \\na necessity. Or if the goal is to increase athletic \\nperformance in a specific sport, the exercises \\nshould mimic the types of movements performed \\nin the sport, and they should be performed at \\na similar speed as those movements. This prin-\\nciple is one of the most important in strength \\ntraining because if it is not being met, all other \\nprinciples are negated.\\nprinciple of progressive overload —The practice \\nof continually increasing the intensity of the \\nworkout as the muscle becomes accustomed \\nto that intensity level. This can be done by \\nincreasing the weight lifted, the number of repe-\\ntitions performed, or the total number of sets; or \\nit can be done by decreasing the rest between \\nsets.

This is one of \\nthe most critical principles of strength training \\nas well as one of the earliest developed. This \\nprinciple was established just after World War II \\nby the research of DeLorme (1945) and DeLo -\\nrme and Watkins (1948). Without providing the \\nmuscles with progressive overload, continual \\nadaptations in muscle strength and size would \\ncease. For example, at the start of a strength \\ntraining program, performing three sets of 10 \\nreps on the bench press with 135 pounds may \\nbe a challenge. After several weeks of training, \\nperforming three sets of 10 reps on the bench \\npress with 135 pounds will become easy. At this \\nstage, training adaptations will cease unless \\nthe weight is increased above 135 pounds, the \\nreps are increased above 10 reps, the sets are \\nincreased to more than three, or the rest between \\nsets is decreased.\\nprinciple of individuality—The theory that any train-\\ning program must consider the specific needs or \\ngoals and abilities of the person for whom it is \\ndesigned. For example, a beginning bodybuilder \\nwith the goal of adding muscle mass would \\nhave a much different training program than an \\nadvanced bodybuilder with the same goal. The \\ndifference in their training programs is based not \\non their desired training outcomes but on their \\ntraining experiences. The advanced trainer would \\nrequire more volume and high-intensity training \\ntechniques to reach the same goal as the begin-\\nner. On the other hand, an advanced lifter who \\nhas the goal of gaining muscle mass would train \\nmuch differently than an advanced lifter with the \\ngoal of gaining muscle strength. Here the differ-\\nence in their training programs is based on their \\ndifferent goals. In general, the advanced lifter \\nwith the goal of gaining more muscle strength \\nwould train with fewer reps, heavier weight, and \\nlower volume than the advanced lifter with the \\nmuscle mass goal.\\nprinciple of variation —The simple fact that no \\nmatter how effective a program is, it will be effec-\\ntive only for a short period. Once a person has \\nexperienced the specific adaptations that a par-\\nticular training program is designed to provide, a \\nnew stimulus must be imposed on the muscles \\nor continued progress will be stagnated. This \\nis the foundation of periodization (discussed in \\nchapter 3) and is the reason that training cycles \\nmust be employed.\\nprinciple of maintenance—As a person reaches \\nhis or her goals, it takes less work to maintain \\nthat level of strength or muscle mass. If he or \\nshe is happy with that level, the frequency of \\ntraining can be reduced. This is typically a good \\ntime to involve more cross-training so that other \\nfitness components can be developed.\\nprinciple of reversibility—The fact that once the \\nstrength training program is discontinued or not \\nmaintained at the minimal level of frequency and \\nintensity, the strength or hypertrophy adaptations \\nthat were made with that program will not only \\nstop forward progression but will also revert back \\nto the starting level.\\nWARMING UP , STRETCHING, \\nAND COOLING DOWN\\nYou might have trouble finding the time to sneak \\nin a workout, let alone worry about properly warm-\\ning up before and stretching after the workout. \\nHowever, how you prepare and end your strength \\ntraining sessions can have a big impact on your \\nresults as well as your quality of life, especially as \\nyou get older. Try your best to warm up properly \\nbefore each workout and do some stretching to \\ncool down after the workout.\\nA general warm-up of 5 to 10 minutes on a tread-\\nmill or stationary bike, some calisthenics, or, better \\nyet, dynamic stretches such as high kicks and arm \\ncircles will raise your body temperature sufficiently. \\nA study by Taylor and colleagues (2011) found that \\njust a 0.3 °F increase in body temperature allowed \\nathletes to jump 6 percent higher and have 10 per-\\ncent more power. In other words, a short warm-up \\nallows you to be stronger and perform better in the \\ngym. Doing dynamic stretches as a warm-up fur -\\nther increases muscle power and strength during \\nthe warm-up. On the other hand, static stretching \\nbefore strength training may impair muscle power \\nand strength during the workout.\\nYour best bet is to save static stretching for the \\ncool-down and as a way to increase your flexibility. \\nThis form of stretching is particularly effective for \\nmaximizing flexibility when done after workouts \\nwhen the body is warmer and the muscles are more \\nfatigued. This book does not focus on stretching \\nexercises, so for a good resource, pick up the book \\nFull-Body Flexibility, Second Edition, by Jay Blahnik \\n(Human Kinetics 2011).'),\n",

Considering this \\ntime frame, a single workout may seem inconse -\\nquential to the overall program. Yet the design of \\neach single workout is just as important as the \\noverall program. This is because each workout \\nadds up sequentially to create the long-term train-\\ning program that will provide the adaptations that \\nthe program imparts. This chapter discusses the \\nprinciples involved in designing a single strength \\ntraining workout.\\nEvery workout is composed of at least five spe-\\ncific program variables that you can manipulate \\nin order to alter the workout: choice of exercises, \\norder of exercises, number of sets, resistance, \\nand rest taken between sets. You must carefully \\nchoose these variables to get a workout that is \\nappropriate for your level of fitness and that initi-\\nates the desired adaptations.\\nAlthough strength athletes such as Olympic \\nweightlifters, powerlifters, and bodybuilders have \\nmanipulated these variables for many years, William \\nJ. Kraemer, PhD, is credited with scientifically deter-\\nmining and recording what he has termed the five \\nspecific clusters of acute program variables (see \\ntable 2.1). The systematic alteration of these acute \\nvariables results in the periodized training program.\\nCHOICE OF EXERCISES\\nWhile all acute variables of a program are criti -\\ncal to a person’s progress, choice of exercise is \\narguably one of the most critical. The reasoning \\nbehind this is that if you are not training the appro-\\npriate muscle groups, then all other variables are \\nsomewhat meaningless. Simply put, muscles that \\nare not trained will not benefit from the program. \\nTherefore, choosing the proper exercises for each \\nworkout is the first step in creating an effective \\nstrength program.\\nTABLE 2.1 Program Design Details\\nVariable Specifics\\nChoice of \\nexercises\\nPrimary exercises\\nAssistance exercises\\nMultijoint exercises\\nSingle-joint exercises\\nExercise equipment\\nOrder of \\nexercises\\nPrimary exercises followed by \\nassistance exercises\\nLarger muscle groups followed by \\nsmaller muscle groups\\nLagging muscle groups trained first\\nStraight sets for each exercise\\nSupersets\\nNumber of \\nsets\\nVolume effects\\nSingle sets\\nMultiple sets\\nNumber of sets performed per exercise\\nNumber of sets performed per muscle \\ngroup\\nNumber of sets performed per workout\\nResistance \\n(intensity)\\nPercentage of 1RM\\nRM target zone\\nOMNI-resistance exercise scale\\nRest period \\nbetween \\nsets\\nDependent on resistance used\\nDependent on muscle adaptation \\ndesired\\nDependent on metabolic pathway \\nbeing trained\\nDependent on training technique\\nAdapted from S.J.

For competitive athletes, \\nthe primary exercises not only should target the \\nsame muscle groups that are used in competi -\\ntion but should also include some exercises that \\nmimic the movements performed in their sports. \\nFor example, the primary exercises for an Olympic \\nweightlifter are the clean and jerk and the snatch; \\nfor a powerlifter they are the bench press, squat, \\nand deadlift; for an offensive lineman they are the \\nsquat and incline bench press.\\nPrimary exercises usually are multijoint move -\\nments such as the bench press, squat, and \\ndeadlift. These exercises require the coordinated \\nuse of multiple muscle groups. Because several \\nlarge muscle groups are used in performing these \\nexercises, they tend to be the ones in which the \\nmost weight can be lifted. For instance, the world \\nrecords in the deadlift and the squat are well over \\n900 and 1,100 pounds (408 and 499 kilograms), \\nrespectively. The world record in the barbell biceps \\ncurl (although this is not a lift that is sanctioned by \\nany powerlifting federation), a single-joint exercise \\n(typically referred to as an assistance exercise), \\nis not much more than 400 pounds (181 kilo -\\ngrams). Because the primary exercises call for \\ngreat strength and coordination, they should be \\nperformed early in the workout when the muscle \\ngroups are the least fatigued.\\nAssistance exercises typically are single-joint \\nexercises such as the biceps curl, triceps exten-\\nsion, and deltoid lateral raise. These exercises \\noften involve only a single muscle group. Because \\nonly one muscle group is working to lift the weight, \\nthese exercises usually involve much lighter \\nweight than primary exercises do. For power -\\nlifters and other strength athletes, assistance \\nexercises are usually done toward the end of the \\nworkout after the major muscle groups are fairly \\nfatigued from performing the primary exercises. \\nAn exception to the rule that most assistance \\nexercises are single-joint exercises is core train -\\ning. Training the core (the deep muscles in the \\nabdominal cavity and lower back) involves com -\\nplicated movement patterns that involve multiple \\njoints and force the core musculature to work at \\nstabilizing the body.\\nFor those interested in building muscle size, all \\nexercises also can be divided into multijoint and \\nsingle-joint exercises. However, the terms used in \\nbodybuilding circles are \\nmultijoint and isolation \\nexercises. Isolation implies that the single-joint \\nmovement is isolating the major muscle group and \\nforcing it to perform all the work in that exercise \\nwithout the help from other muscle groups. An \\nexample of this is the leg extension. While most \\nmajor muscle groups have both multijoint and \\nisolation exercises that target them, the biceps, \\nforearms, calves, and abdominals are muscle \\ngroups that are trained usually with just isolation \\nexercises. For a list of multijoint and isolation \\nexercises for most major muscle groups, refer to \\ntable 2.3.\\nTABLE 2.2 Primary and Assistance \\nExercises\\nPrimary exercises Assistance exercises\\nPower clean\\nDeadlift\\nSquat\\nLeg press\\nBench press\\nMilitary press\\nBarbell row\\nPull-up\\nKnee extension\\nLeg curl\\nChest fly\\nDeltoid lateral raise\\nBiceps curl\\nTriceps extension\\nWrist curl\\nCalf raise\\nAbdominal crunch\\nTABLE 2.3 Multijoint and Isolation Exercises\\nMuscle \\ngroup Multijoint exercises Isolation exercises\\nChest Bench press\\nDumbbell bench \\npress\\nDumbbell fly\\nCable crossover\\nShoulders Barbell overhead \\npress\\nUpright row\\nLateral raise\\nFront raise\\nTriceps Close-grip bench \\npress\\nDips\\nTriceps pressdown\\nLying triceps \\nextension\\nBiceps Barbell curl\\nSeated incline curl\\nForearms Wrist curl\\nReverse wrist curl\\nQuadriceps Squat\\nLeg press\\nLeg extension\\nHamstrings Squat\\nDeadlift\\nLeg curl\\nRomanian deadlift\\nCalves Standing calf raise\\nSeated calf raise\\nAbdominals Crunch\\nReverse crunch'),\n",

Here, the use \\nof a cable apparatus or resistance tubing would \\nbe a better exercise choice. Choosing appropriate \\nstrength training equipment is discussed in more \\ndetail in chapter 4.\\nORDER OF EXERCISES\\nHow the specific exercises that make up a single \\nworkout are ordered will determine not only the \\neffectiveness of the workout but also the particular \\nadaptations that the program imparts. Therefore, \\nthe order in which exercises are performed must \\ncorrespond with the specific training goals.\\nIn training for strength, the primary exercises are \\nperformed first in the workout relative to assistance \\nexercises. The logic behind this is the fact that \\nprimary exercises typically involve numerous large \\nmuscle groups working together to lift relatively \\nheavy weight. Therefore, these exercises must be \\ndone early enough in the program that fatigue is \\nnot an issue. Performing single-joint exercises first \\nwill compromise the amount of weight a person can \\nlift on the primary exercises and may even make \\nthe person more susceptible to injury, because \\nform tends to suffer when muscles are fatigued.\\nIf building muscle size is the primary goal, then \\nmultijoint exercises should be performed first \\nwith isolation exercises performed later in the \\nworkout. The multijoint exercises help to build \\nmuscle size because it is possible to train with \\nheavier weight on them. An exception to this rule \\ninvolves a common bodybuilding technique known \\nas preexhaust. This technique involves the use of \\nsingle-joint exercises before multijoint exercises \\nin an effort to exhaust a particular muscle group \\nso that it becomes the weak link in the multijoint \\nexercise. This concept is discussed in detail in \\nchapter 6.\\nIf multiple muscle groups are trained in a work-\\nout, such as in whole-body workouts, and only one \\nexercise per major muscle group is performed, \\nthen ordering exercises involves determining the \\nmost critical muscle groups based on the goals of \\nthe person. Typically, larger-sized muscle groups \\n(such as the legs and back) are trained before \\nsmaller muscle groups (such as the shoulders and \\nbiceps) for the same reason mentioned previously: \\nLarger muscle groups need to be trained before \\nfatigue is an issue.\\nNUMBER OF SETS\\nA set is a grouping of repetitions that is followed \\nby a rest interval. The number of sets performed \\nin a workout is one of the factors affecting the \\ntotal volume (sets \\ue033 repetitions \\ue033 resistance) of \\nexercise. Therefore, it must be consistent not only \\nwith the individual’s strength goals but also with \\nhis or her current level of fitness.\\nGenerally speaking, it is accepted that multiple \\nsets are more beneficial for developing strength \\nand muscle mass. In fact, this stance is supported \\nin guidelines set by the National Strength and \\nConditioning Association (Pearson et al. 2000) \\nand the American College of Sports Medicine \\n(Kraemer et al. 2002). Single sets are effective \\nfor building strength for beginning weightlifters \\nor for maintaining strength during periods when \\nit is necessary or desired to reduce the volume \\nperformed. Beginners starting with a single-set \\nprogram should progressively increase the number \\nof sets to make continued adaptations in strength.\\nWhen designing a workout, one should consider \\nthe number of sets performed per exercise, the \\nnumber of sets per muscle group, and the total \\nnumber of sets for the workout. The number of \\nsets per exercise typically varies depending on \\nthe strength training program. Most programs \\ndesigned for the intermediate to advanced weight \\ntrainer incorporate between three and six sets per \\nexercise. This set range is considered optimal for \\nincreasing strength. How many sets one should \\nperform per muscle group is a question that is \\nmost applicable to bodybuilding-type training, in \\nwhich numerous exercises are performed for each \\nmuscle group. This is in opposition to strength train-\\ning programs for conditioning athletes, which may \\ntypically involve only one exercise per major muscle \\ngroup. The number of sets per muscle group may \\nrange from 3 to 24 but ultimately depends on the \\nnumber of exercises performed for that muscle \\ngroup, the number of muscle groups trained in that \\nworkout, the intensity used, and where the person \\nis in his or her training cycle.

Care must be taken \\nso that not too many total sets are performed, \\nparticularly when intensity is high, since these vari-\\nables greatly influence total work. Performing too \\nmuch total work over time stresses the body and \\ncan lead to overtraining in the long run. Although \\ndefining how much work is too much is a difficult \\ntask because many factors are involved, such as \\nthe person’s training experience and genetics, \\ngeneral recommendations can be made. Typically \\ndoing more than 20 sets per muscle group for an \\nextended period can lead to overtraining. In addi-\\ntion, doing more than 40 sets per workout, even \\nwhen multiple muscle groups are trained in that \\nworkout, can lead to overtraining if done too fre -\\nquently or if proper nutrition is not being followed.\\nAs for any other acute variables of training, \\nthe number of sets should be manipulated to \\nprevent stagnation of training adaptations. The \\nmost important variable of training that influences \\nthe number of sets that should be performed is \\nintensity (the amount of weight lifted). The greater \\nthe intensity, the greater the stress placed on the \\nmuscle, and thus the lower the number of sets that \\nshould be performed. Therefore, the total number \\nof sets in a training cycle should vary inversely with \\ntraining intensity. In fact, training with too many \\ntotal sets can be detrimental to the adaptations \\nof strength training and lead to overtraining.\\nRESISTANCE\\nThe term intensity refers to the amount of weight \\nlifted (or resistance used) on a particular set. Alter-\\nnatively, many bodybuilders use intensity to refer \\nto the difficulty of a set or a workout, regardless of \\nthe amount of weight used. For example, a body-\\nbuilder may perform a high-intensity set involving \\nvery light weight at extremely high repetitions until \\nmuscle failure is reached. The intensity of that \\nset would be even higher if the spotter helped the \\nbodybuilder get three extra forced reps at the end \\nof that set. However, according to the formal defi-\\nnition of \\nintensity, that set would be categorized \\nas low intensity. Therefore, to avoid confusion, the \\nterm \\nresistance will be used when referring to the \\namount of weight used.\\nThe resistance used is one of the most import-\\nant variables in a training program, ranking second \\nonly to exercise choice. The amount of resistance \\nused for a set is inversely related to the number \\nof repetitions performed. That is, the heavier \\nthe weight, the fewer the repetitions that can be \\nperformed. One of the most common ways that \\nresistance is measured is through the use of a \\npercentage of the repetition maximum (RM). For \\nexample, an exercise can be prescribed at 80 \\npercent of the individual’s 1RM.\\nIf, for instance, the person’s 1RM on the bench \\npress is 300 pounds (136 kilograms), then\\n300 pounds \\ue033 .80 = 240 pounds\\nUsing this method does require frequent 1RM \\ntesting to ensure that accurate training resistance \\nis used. This method may be desirable for certain \\nstrength athletes because recurrent testing is a \\ncommonly used measure of an athlete’s progress \\nand a predictor of preparedness for competition. \\nOlympic weightlifters should use this method reg-\\nularly because of the skill component required for \\nthat type of lifting. Competitive weightlifters must \\nuse precisely measured resistance for their train-\\ning phases. Powerlifters also commonly use this \\nmethod because the defining moment in their sport \\nis the amount of weight they can perform at 1RM \\non the bench press, squat, and deadlift. However, \\nmany top powerlifters train with percentages that \\nare based on the 1RM they are predicting to lift in \\ncompetition. The down side to prescribing exercise \\nintensity with RM percentages is the fact that the \\namount of reps you can perform at a certain per -\\ncentage of 1RM can vary depending on experience, \\nthe muscle group being trained, and the exercise \\nequipment used.\\nFor bodybuilders and other fitness enthusiasts, \\nfrequent testing of 1RM is not convenient or often \\nfeasible. It would be too time consuming because \\nof the larger number of exercises they typically use. \\nIn addition, many of the exercises they perform are \\nnot conducive to 1RM testing. Although charts are \\ndevised for estimating 1RM based on the number \\nof reps that can be completed at a certain weight, \\nthese are far from accurate. For serious weight \\ntrainers, an RM target zone is the easiest way \\nto monitor training resistance. This is depicted \\nas 10RM or 5RM and refers to a resistance that \\nlimits them to that number of repetitions. As their \\nstrength increases, they simply move to a heavier \\nweight but shoot for the same RM goal. This allows \\nthem to continually stay in the repetition range \\nthey are shooting for without the need to test their \\n1RM. Worth mentioning here is that many strength'),\n",

This is a 10-point \\nsubjective scale (see figure 2.1) that is a modified \\nversion of the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) \\nscale that was originally described by Borg (1982) \\nand used mostly for monitoring aerobic exercise. \\nEach value from 1 to 10 on the OMNI represents \\napproximately a 10 percent increase in repetition \\nmaximum. For example, the use of 100 percent \\nof a person’s 1RM elicits a rating of 10 on the \\nOMNI-resistance exercise scale, while the use of \\n50 percent of the person’s 1RM corresponds to a \\nrating of 5 on the scale. The OMNI-resistance exer-\\ncise scale is not a precise quantitative scale but \\nmore a qualitative scale that determines how hard \\nthe weight feels to the lifter. For this reason, it is \\nbest used by trainers who are prescribing strength \\ntraining to inexperienced lifters.\\nToday, thanks to the many years of trial and \\nerror by athletes and the numerous research \\nstudies to confirm the original inclinations, it is \\nnow well established that using certain resistance \\nintensities provides corresponding results. This \\ninformation can be used in designing a repetition \\nmaximum continuum as seen in figure 2.2. This \\nfigure is a modification of the continuum devised \\nby Fleck and Kraemer (2004) that is recognized \\nas the most acceptable by exercise scientists \\nand strength coaches. The continuum in figure \\n2.2 ranges in maximal repetitions from 1 to 25, \\nas does the original, but adds the adaptation \\nof muscle hypertrophy. On the lower end of the \\ncontinuum, strength gains are more pronounced, \\nparticularly when using maximal repetitions in the \\nrange of 1 to 6, or about 80 to 100 percent of 1RM \\n(O’Shea 1966; Weiss, Coney, and Clark 1999). \\nEnhanced muscle hypertrophy is most notable \\nwhen training with repetition maximums in the 8 \\nto 12 range, which corresponds to about 70 to 80 \\npercent 1RM (Kraemer, Fleck, and Evans 1996). \\nAnd muscular endurance benefits occur when repe-\\ntition maximums of 12 and above, or 70 percent \\nof 1RM and below, are used (Stone and Coulter \\n1994). New evidence also suggests that these \\nFIGURE 2.1 OMNI-resistance exercise scale.\\nReprinted from R.J.

This is because each \\nadaptation is related to the others. For example, \\nincreasing both maximal strength and muscle \\nendurance beneficially affects muscle hypertrophy. \\nSo while the person should spend the majority of \\ntraining time using the repetition range that best \\nfits his or her major goals, the periodic cycling of \\nother intensities will enhance this goal.\\nOne major assumption that the continuum of \\nrepetition maximums makes is that all repeti -\\ntions are performed at a moderate speed. Yet the \\nspeed of a rep can be increased or decreased, \\nparticularly at light to moderate loads. And this \\nchange in speed will dramatically alter the muscle \\nadaptations. In general, fast repetition speeds \\nwith very light weight are best for building speed \\nstrength, or power, when few repetitions are per-\\nformed. In contrast, slow to moderate repetitions \\nwith a submaximal weight are better for producing \\nadaptations in muscle endurance and hypertro -\\nphy as the time the muscle is under tension is \\nincreased. As an example, using a weight that is \\nabout 30 to 45 percent of 1RM to do three reps \\nas fast as possible builds speed strength (power) \\nand has little effect if any on muscle hypertrophy \\nor endurance.\\nREST PERIOD BETWEEN SETS\\nHow long a weightlifter should rest between sets is \\ndependent on numerous factors. These include the \\nresistance being used, the goals of the lifter, and \\nthe metabolic pathways that need to be trained. \\nThe general consensus is that the lower the reps \\nbeing performed (that is, the higher the resistance \\nintensity), the longer the rest periods that should \\nbe taken. And so as the periodized routine alters \\nresistance intensity, so too do the rest periods \\nchange accordingly.\\nIf a person is training for maximal strength \\nor power, he or she should take long rest peri -\\nods between sets. This is because lifting heavy \\nweight for low reps requires energy derived from \\nanaerobic metabolism, called the ATP-PC (ade -\\nnosine triphosphate-phosphocreatine) system. \\nThis metabolic pathway provides the immediate \\nenergy required for lifting heavy weight or perform-\\ning explosive movements for a short period. This \\nsystem requires more than 3 minutes of rest for \\nthe majority of recovery to occur. Therefore, the \\nrecommendation is to rest at least 3 to more than \\n5 minutes when training for maximal strength or \\npower. The general guidelines are as follows: resis-\\ntance at less than 5RM requires over 5 minutes of \\nrest, 5-7RM requires 3-5 minutes, 8-10RM requires \\n2-3 minutes, 11-13RM requires 1-2 minutes, and \\nover 13RM requires about 1 minute (Kraemer \\n2003). This level of rest ensures that fatigue \\nwill be minimal at the start of a new set, and in \\nturn, strength can be near maximal. Similarly, if a \\nstrength athlete or other athlete performs short \\nbouts of high-intensity exercise with long rest \\nperiods between, the athlete should rest at least \\nthree minutes between sets.\\nWhen training for muscle hypertrophy (which is \\nbest attained with reps in the range of 8 to 12), \\nshorter rest periods appear to be the most benefi-\\ncial. Resting less than three minutes between sets \\nstresses the anaerobic energy systems, and this \\nis often recommended for bodybuilding training. \\nThis is because fatigue is believed to play some \\nrole in the pathways leading to muscle growth. \\nOne possibility involves lactate, which dramatically \\nincreases as reps increase and rest between sets \\ndecreases. \\nFor athletes interested in improving muscle \\nendurance, low intensity (less than 60 percent \\n1RM), high repetitions of 15 and beyond, and short \\nrest periods (under one minute) seem to be the \\nbest plan.

Because fatigue is associated with muscle \\nhypertrophy, many bodybuilders also frequently use \\nthis style of training.\\nSome styles of training use such minute rest \\nperiods between sets that they are classified in \\ngym circles as using “no rest” between sets. This \\nmeans that you would take no deliberate rest but \\ninstead immediately move to the next exercise. \\nSuch training methods include circuit training \\nand the various forms of superset training, which \\nincludes compound sets, triple sets, and giant sets \\n(see chapter 6 for more detailed explanations of \\nthese methods). With each of these methods, a \\ncertain number of sets of different exercises are \\ndone back to back with no rest between exercise \\nsets. Only after you complete the prescribed \\nnumber of exercises (which can vary from 2 to as \\nmany as 12) would you take a rest period. Then \\nyou would repeat the cycle anywhere from one to \\nfive times depending on the program.\\nADDITIONAL FACTORS\\nThe five original acute training variables discussed \\nearlier were classified and organized decades ago. \\nAs with any science, progress has been made to \\nfurther our understanding of resistance training. \\nBesides determining the best exercises to use, \\nthe correct order of those exercises, the proper \\nresistance to use, the optimal number of sets to \\ndo, and the right amount of rest to take between \\nsets, other factors are to be considered.\\nAnother acute training variable that can be \\nadded to the list is repetition speed, or rep tempo. \\nGenerally speaking, typical rep speed in strength \\ntraining lasts about two to three seconds to \\ncomplete the positive (concentric) and negative \\n(eccentric) portions of each rep. This is considered \\na controlled pace and is the pace taught by most \\nstrength coaches and personal trainers. However, \\nsome programs rely on the manipulation of rep \\nspeed. Speeding up the time it takes to complete \\na rep—in the range of one second or less—has \\nbeen shown to be an effective way to increase \\nmuscle power. See Ballistic Strength Training \\nin chapter 9 for an explanation of how to train \\nwith fast, explosive reps. Some strength training \\nexperts also believe that slowing down a rep—in \\nthe range of 10 to 20 seconds—can enhance \\nmuscle endurance as well as size. Research in \\nthis area is limited, but anecdotal reports are \\npositive. See Slow-Repetition Training in chapter \\n6 for an explanation of how to train using very \\nslow reps, and see Speed-Set Training in chapter \\n6 as well.\\nAnother factor you should also be concerned \\nabout is how frequently you train. The frequency \\nat which muscle groups are trained can be more \\ncritical than any of the acute variables of training \\ndiscussed previously. The reason has to do with \\nrecovery. It is generally accepted that you should \\nwait until a muscle has recovered from a previous \\nworkout before training the muscle again. Muscle \\nrecovery, however, is an individual thing that is \\ninfluenced by factors such as lifting experience, \\nintensity of the workout, and total volume. In most \\ninstances it is best to get 2 to 7 days of rest for \\neach muscle group. This will be determined by \\nhow you split your training. \\nTraining splits refer to \\nhow you break down training days. For example, do \\nyou train your whole body during every workout, or \\ndo you train only one or two muscle groups each \\nworkout? For obvious reasons, the more workouts \\nit takes you to train all the major muscle groups \\nof the body, the more rest you will take between \\nworkouts for the same muscle group. Training \\nsplits and training frequency are discussed in more \\ndetail in chapters 5 and 8.\\nSUMMARY\\nThe design of every workout is a critical component \\nof the design of the strength training program. \\nRegardless of your goal, you must carefully select \\nappropriate acute variables to optimize the adap-\\ntations that occur in every workout. In designing \\nthe most effective training programs to reach your \\ngoals, you must carefully consider the choice of \\nexercises and the order, intensity used, number of \\nsets performed, and rest periods between sets. \\nIn addition to these variables, you may want to \\nconsider the speed at which you perform your \\nreps. Last but not least is the frequency at which \\nyou train muscle groups.

The original concept was \\ndeveloped in the former Eastern Bloc countries in \\nthe late 1950s to optimize athletes’ adaptations \\nto resistance training. More important, period -\\nization revolves around the athlete’s competitive \\ncalendar so that he or she is at a competitive \\npeak for competition.\\nThe basis of periodization is general adaptation \\nsyndrome (GAS), which describes three stages that \\nan organism—such as an athlete—goes through \\nwhen exposed to a novel stress (Selye 1936). As \\na new stress is placed on the body (for example, \\nheavy training in the range of three to five reps), \\nthe muscle first goes through an alarm reaction. \\nDuring this stage the athlete momentarily gets \\nweaker. But with continued exposure to the stress \\n(successive workouts), the body enters the stage \\nof adaptation. In this stage the body supercompen-\\nsates for the stress—such as increasing muscle \\nstrength—to better deal with the stress. If the body \\nis continually exposed to the same stress for too \\nlong, it may enter the stage of exhaustion, where \\nits adaptation to the stress may actually decline. \\nThis may mean that the strength gains the athlete \\nmade during the adaptation stage will cease, and \\nstagnation may set in. It may even lead to an \\nactual decline in strength. Although this theory \\nis now considered a simplistic take on the body’s \\nresponse to stress, it does hold true and explains \\nthe reason periodization is so important for proper \\nadaptation to strength training.\\nYou must expose the muscle to any one training \\nstyle for just long enough to reap the benefits but \\navoid a nosedive of those positive adaptations. \\nAt this stage a new training style should be \\nintroduced, and the cycle continues. A simplistic \\ntake on periodization is the maxim of “everything \\nworks, but nothing works forever.” This is a major \\ntheme of this book and is the reason it offers so \\nmany training methods. Having a large arsenal of \\ntraining methods (as provided in chapters 6 and \\n9) to use for short periods and continually cycling \\nthem in a systematic order will prevent stagnation \\nand maximize training adaptations.\\nThe three periodization schemes most com -\\nmonly used by strength coaches, which are the \\nthree most extensively researched, are classic \\nstrength and power periodization, reverse linear \\nperiodization, and undulating periodization. \\nAlthough there are many other more obscure \\nperiodization schemes out there, a discussion \\nincluding these three will cover the premise \\nbehind periodization. Regardless of the exact \\nplan, periodized strength training programs have \\nbeen shown through research to be significantly \\nmore effective than nonperiodized programs for \\nincreasing strength, power, and athletic perfor -\\nmance in both men and women (Kraemer et al. \\n2003; Marx et al. 2001; Rhea and Alderman \\n2004; Willoughby 1993).\\nCLASSIC PERIODIZATION\\nThe name implies that this system is the hallmark \\nperiodization scheme most associated with the \\nterm \\nperiodization. In its most general form, clas-\\nsic periodization divides a long-term training period \\ncalled the \\nmacrocycle (which typically involves six \\nmonths to one year but may be up to four years, \\nsuch as with Olympic athletes) into smaller phases \\ncalled \\nmesocycles (usually lasting several weeks \\nto months), which are also subdivided into weekly \\nmicrocycles. The strength training progresses over \\nthe macrocycle from low resistance (intensity) \\nto high intensity with total volume following the \\nopposite progression, from high to low. A sche -\\nmatic overview of the classic strength and power \\nperiodization scheme can be seen in figure 3.1 \\nand table 3.1.'),\n",

The first phase, or mesocycle, is classified \\nas the hypertrophy phase and is categorized as \\nbeing low intensity. Reps are around 8 to 12 and \\nsometimes as high as 20. It is considered very \\nhigh in volume because sets are usually in the \\nrange of 4 to 5 for each exercise. The goal of \\nthis phase is typically to prepare the athlete for \\nthe high-intensity training that is to follow. The \\nmuscle hypertrophy experienced in this phase \\nwill enhance the gains in strength and power an \\nathlete will make in the later stages. Although \\nthis is termed the hypertrophy phase, it should \\nnot be confused with a periodized program a \\nbodybuilder would use. Hypertrophy is the main \\ngoal in a bodybuilding program, not something an \\nathlete may do only for several months. In some \\nperiodized programs designed for athletes, the \\nhypertrophy phase may be preceded by what is \\nknown as a general preparedness (GP) phase. This \\nis especially true if the person being trained is a \\nrank beginner or an athlete who is returning after \\nan off-season where little, if any, training took \\nplace. This would provide a means of preparing \\nan athlete for the hypertrophy phase with very low \\nintensity and moderate- to high-volume training.\\nThe next mesocycle is usually the strength \\nphase. As the name implies, the major goal during \\nthis phase is to maximize muscle strength. This \\nphase is typically moderate to high in intensity \\nwith reps in the range of two to six and the goal \\nto build up muscle strength. It’s somewhat high \\nin volume, with three or four sets performed per \\nexercise and fewer total exercises performed per \\nmuscle group than during the hypertrophy phase. \\nFollowing the strength phase is the power phase. \\nIt is similar to the strength phase in that the inten-\\nsity is high (reps are in the range of two to three). \\nThe volume is a bit lower; sets usually are about \\nthree per exercise. The point of this phase is to \\nstart transferring the strength gains made during \\nthe first two phases into more explosive power \\nthat serves well for competition.\\nThe final two mesocycles prepare the athlete \\nfor competition. The peaking phase follows the \\npower phase. It is categorized by low volume (only \\none to three sets per exercise are formed) and \\nvery high intensity (reps as low as one per set). \\nThis phase gets the athlete ready for competition \\nVolume\\nIntensity\\nSkill training\\nMajor competitions\\nHypertrophy Strength/\\npower\\nPeaking Active rest\\nFIGURE 3.1 Classic strength and power periodization scheme.\\nAdapted, by permission, from S.J.

After this \\nphase, the athlete drops the strength training \\nand undergoes a period of active rest just before \\ncompetition. The active rest phase is categorized \\nby activity other than strength training such as \\nswimming, hiking, or sport activities like basketball \\nand tennis. This phase usually lasts for only about \\none to two weeks before a competition to allow \\nthe body to recover from all the strenuous training \\nso that it can perform at its best. After competi -\\ntion, this phase may actually continue for several \\nweeks before the periodized training scheme starts \\nagain. For this reason, the active rest phase is \\noften referred to as the \\ntransition phase. Most \\nstrength experts using the classic strength and \\npower periodization program will continue the \\nmesocycle phases for anywhere from three weeks \\nto three months. However, a compressed version \\nof this program would involve changing the phases \\n(hence the intensity and volume) every week. Then \\nthe cycle repeats itself.\\nAlthough classic strength periodization \\nschemes can allow for adaptations in strength \\ntraining, some issues need to be considered with \\nthese models. The first consideration is the fact \\nthat the higher-volume training phase may lead \\nto fatigue if followed consecutively for too long. \\nThis could be a problem for athletes who must \\ncompete at various times throughout the year. The \\nsecond consideration is the fact that the muscle \\nhypertrophy gained during the hypertrophy phase \\nmay not be maintained very well during the later \\nstages, where volume gets considerably low. This \\ncould be a problem for bodybuilders and other \\nathletes who are concerned about muscle mass. \\nTherefore, other periodized schemes have been \\ndeveloped and tested in the gym as well as in \\nthe lab.\\nREVERSE LINEAR PERIODIZATION\\nReverse linear periodization takes the classic \\nstrength and power periodization scheme and \\nruns it backward. Whereas the goal of the classic \\nperiodization model is to maximize an athlete’s \\nstrength and power, the goal of the reverse linear \\nmodel is to maximize muscle hypertrophy or \\nendurance strength, depending on the rep range \\nthat the program concludes with (8 to 12 for \\nhypertrophy and 20 to 30 for endurance strength). \\nResearch supports the concept that the reverse \\nlinear periodization scheme is more effective for \\nincreasing endurance strength than the classic \\nmodel (Rhea et al. 2003).\\nIn essence, the reverse linear model starts with \\nthe power phase, where intensity is very high (two \\nor three reps per set) and volume is low (three \\nsets per exercise). The peaking phase is usually \\nskipped because the athlete is not preparing for \\na competition in which power and strength matter. \\nAfter the athlete follows the power phase for sev-\\neral weeks, the strength phase starts. Again, the \\nstrength phase uses moderate to high intensity \\n(two to six reps per set) and slightly higher volume \\nthan the power phase (three or four sets per exer-\\ncise). The goal of these first two phases is to build \\nthe strength and power to optimize gains in mass \\nor endurance strength.\\nBeing able to lift heavier weight for the desired \\nnumber of reps during the hypertrophy phase can \\nresult in significant gains in muscle mass as well \\nas muscle endurance. The hypertrophy stage \\ncomes last in the program and involves lower \\nintensity (8 to 12 reps per set) and high volume, \\nwhich is the best prescription for building muscle \\nmass. This stage is a good systematic approach \\nto gaining muscle mass, which makes it a smart \\nperiodized plan for bodybuilders. See figure 3.2 \\nfor a sample reverse linear periodization scheme \\nfor muscle hypertrophy.\\nTo make the reverse linear model a better fit for \\noptimizing endurance strength, the power phase \\ncan be eliminated. That means it would start with \\nthe strength phase, then move to the hypertrophy \\nphase, then move to an endurance phase (where \\nthe reps are in the range of 20 to 30), and finally \\nmove to an active rest phase if the athlete is \\ntraining for a competition. A diagram of this model \\nis shown in figure 3.3. As with any periodization \\nscheme, the acute variables can be manipulated \\nwithin each stage to improve the result of the \\nprogram. For instance, a reverse linear model can \\nstart with reps in the 8 to 10 range, then progress \\nto the range of 12 to 15, and end in the range of \\n20 to 30.\\nUNDULATING PERIODIZATION\\nAs the name implies, undulating periodization fol-\\nlows a less linear scheme than does the classic \\nstrength (power) scheme or the reverse linear peri-\\nodization scheme.

One study by \\nRhea, Ball, Phillips, and Burkett (2002) found \\nthat undulating periodized training was more \\neffective for developing strength compared to a \\nlinear periodized plan.\\nIn actuality, the sporadic nature of the undu -\\nlating program works as a default for building \\nmuscle, strength, and power. That’s because peri-\\nodization is based on the fact that a physiological \\nsystem makes adaptations to a stress that it is \\nexposed to. Yet if the system is exposed to the \\nstress for too long, the adaptations will plateau \\nand even reverse to some degree. Given that, \\nthe undulating periodized scheme allows the \\nstress (strength training) to be encountered for \\nvery short periods before it is changed and then \\ncycled back in. In this model, the different types \\nof strength training (heavy, light, fast, or what -\\never) are cycled repeatedly from day to day. So \\nit helps to keep the muscle from getting used to \\nthe stimulus, yet it exposes it frequently enough \\nto cause progressive adaptations.\\nMICROCYCLES\\nWith the classic linear periodization model and \\nthe reverse linear periodization model, sticking \\nwith the same rep range for a full mesocycle, \\nwhich can last many weeks, can have some \\ndrawbacks. Some athletes get bored using the \\nsame rep ranges for several weeks. Another \\nissue discussed earlier is the fact that some of \\nthe adaptations made in a previous mesocycle \\nmay be lost in a later mesocycle. For example, \\ngains in muscle size made during the hypertrophy \\nphase may be lost during the strength and power \\nphases where repetitions performed each set \\nrarely exceed 6.\\nUndulating periodization is one way to remedy \\nthe issues of the mesocycles. However, using \\na linear model, whether it is the classic linear \\nscheme or the reverse linear scheme, has merit. \\nMicrocycles may be an even more effective way of \\nusing linearly periodized training schemes.\\nThe term microcycle refers to weekly changes \\nin the weight used and reps performed. For exam-\\nple, if following the classic linear model, week 1 \\nmight be a muscle endurance microcycle with \\nreps of 12 to 15. Week 2 might be the hyper -\\ntrophy microcycle with reps of 8 to 12. Week 3 \\ncontinues increasing the weight and decreasing \\nthe reps for the strength microcycle with reps \\nof 4 to 6. Then in week 4, which could be the \\npower microcycle, reps drop again to just 2 or \\n3 per set. After week 4, the cycle repeats itself \\nwith week 5 returning to the muscle endurance \\nmicrocycle. These microcycles can keep repeating \\nin this order until the athlete is ready for com -\\npetition, or for a noncompetitive strength trainer, \\nthe program is over after 12 weeks or so. See \\ntable 3.3 for a sample linear scheme that uses \\nmicrocycles. This is very similar to the Shortcut to \\nSize (Micromuscle) program that has gained great \\npopularity online due to the extraordinary gains in \\nmuscle size and strength that are possible with \\nthis 12-week program. For more details on this \\nprogram, see chapter 7.\\nTABLE 3.3 Microcycle Scheme*\\nWeek/Microcycle Weight Rep range\\n1: Muscle Endurance Light 12-15\\n2: Hypertrophy Moderate 8-12\\n3: Strength Moderate-\\nheavy\\n4-6\\n4: Power Heavy 2-3\\n* This table shows the weight and rep range changes that occur \\neach week/microcycle when using a linear scheme with microcycles.'),\n",

A great way to \\nincrease muscle size and strength is to use pro -\\ngrams that combine periodization models.\\nA good example of this is pendulum training. \\nIn pendulum training, you start off using a classic \\nlinear periodization model usually with microcycles. \\nTherefore, you might start with reps in the range of \\n8 to 12 in week 1. Then in week 2, reps drop to 6 to \\n8. In week 3, reps drop again to 3 to 5. In week 4, \\nthe order switches to a reverse linear periodization \\nmodel with reps going back up to the 6-to-8 range \\nand then in week 5 to the 8-to-12 range. Then \\nin week 6 it is back to a linear progression with \\nreps dropping to 6 to 8 reps. The program would \\ncontinue swinging back and forth like this similar \\nto a pendulum—hence the name. See table 3.4 \\nfor a sample pendulum scheme.\\nAnother way to combine periodization models \\nis to use both linear and reverse linear models \\nsimultaneously. This works well with a program \\nthat trains each muscle group twice per week. For \\nexample, with a program that uses a two-day split \\nwith chest, back, and shoulders trained in workouts \\n1 and 3 and legs and arms trained in workouts 2 \\nand 4, workouts 1 and 2 could follow a linear order \\nusing a microcycle system of increasing weight and \\ndecreasing reps with each week. Weeks 3 and 4 \\ncould follow a reverse linear order using a micro -\\ncycle system in which the weight decreases and \\nthe reps increase each week. See table 3.5 for an \\nexample of this scheme. What’s interesting when \\nyou consider the order of the rep ranges with two \\nseparate rep ranges being used each week is that \\nthe scheme is similar to an undulating periodiza-\\ntion model. Here workouts 1 and 2 progress from \\n9 to 11 reps in week 1, to 6 to 8 reps in week 2, \\nand to 3 to 5 reps in week 3. Workouts 3 and 4 \\nstart at 12 to 15 reps in week 1, then jump to 16 \\nto 20 reps in week 2, and finally go to 21 to 30 \\nreps in week 3. But when you consider the order \\nTABLE 3.5 Combined Linear and Reverse Linear Scheme \\nMultijoint\\nLinear periodization\\nIncrease weight/decrease reps\\nSingle joint\\nReverse linear periodization\\nIncrease reps/decrease weights\\nMicrocycle\\n1/4\\nMonday:\\nChest\\nTriceps\\nAbs\\nTuesday:\\nShoulders\\nLegs\\nAbs\\nWednesday:\\nBack\\nTraps\\nBiceps\\nThursday:\\nChest\\nTriceps\\nAbs\\nFriday:\\nShoulders\\nLegs\\nAbs\\nSaturday:\\nBack\\nTraps\\nBiceps\\nSunday:\\nOff\\n9 to 11 reps per set 12 to 15 reps per set\\nMicrocycle\\n2/5\\nMonday:\\nChest\\nTriceps\\nAbs\\nTuesday:\\nShoulders\\nLegs\\nAbs\\nWednesday:\\nBack\\nTraps\\nBiceps\\nThursday:\\nChest\\nTriceps\\nAbs\\nFriday:\\nShoulders\\nLegs\\nAbs\\nSaturday:\\nBack\\nTraps\\nBiceps\\nSunday:\\nOff\\n6 to 8 reps per set 16 to 20 reps per set\\nMicrocycle\\n3/6\\nMonday:\\nChest\\nTriceps\\nAbs\\nTuesday:\\nShoulders\\nLegs\\nAbs\\nWednesday:\\nBack\\nTraps\\nBiceps\\nThursday:\\nChest\\nTriceps\\nAbs\\nFriday:\\nShoulders\\nLegs\\nAbs\\nSaturday:\\nBack\\nTraps\\nBiceps\\nSunday:\\nOff\\n3 to 5 reps per set 21 to 30 reps per set\\nAdapted from J.

Rarely will you hear the term used \\nin the gym by bodybuilders or powerlifters. These \\nathletes refer to the concept of periodization as \\ncycling. It may sound cooler, but cycling is just a \\nsimpler term for periodization. Although the minor \\ndetails of cycling for powerlifters and bodybuilders \\nare slightly different from the three periodized \\nschemes discussed previously, they rely on the \\nsame premise: Change is good.\\nPowerlifters use several types of cycles to \\nprepare for a competition. A multitude of these \\nare presented in chapters 9 and 10. The most \\ncommon cycle uses a gradual increase in the \\namount of weight used over time. Usually this \\nstarts out as low as 50 percent of the lifter’s 1RM \\nand progresses up to 100 percent of the 1RM \\nweight for that lift over a 6- to 12-week period. See \\ntable 3.6 for a sample 11-week powerlifting cycle.\\nBodybuilders also use numerous cycling strat -\\negies. In fact, an unlimited number of bodybuild -\\ning cycles could be used. These are covered in \\nchapters 6 and 7. The most common ones used \\nare similar to the reverse linear periodization \\nscheme (table 3.7) and the undulating periodiza-\\ntion scheme (table 3.8). Although these athletes \\nmix up their training frequently, the focus tends to \\nstay on reps in the moderate to high range (8 to \\n20). Occasionally, these athletes train with heavy \\nweight and low reps, but these phases are short \\nand infrequent.\\nTABLE 3.7 Linear Muscle\\nWeeks Reps\\nSets (per \\nexercise)\\nRest \\nbetween sets\\n1-2 6-8 3 3-4 min\\n3-4 8-10 3 2-3 min\\n5-6 10-12 3 1-2 min\\n7-8 12-15 3 <1 min\\nTABLE 3.8 Undulating Muscle\\nWEEK 1\\nDay and muscle \\ngroups Reps\\nSets \\n(per \\nexercise)\\nRest \\nbetween \\nsets\\nMonday (chest, \\nshoulders, triceps)\\n8-10 3 2-3 min\\nTuesday (back, biceps) 12-15 3 <1 min\\nWednesday (legs) 6-8 3 3-4 min\\nThursday (chest, \\nshoulders, triceps)\\n12-15 3 <1 min\\nFriday (back, biceps) 6-8 3 3-4 min\\nSaturday (legs) 10-12 3 1-2 min\\nWEEK 2\\nDay and muscle \\ngroups Reps\\nSets \\n(per \\nexercise)\\nRest \\nbetween \\nsets\\nMonday (chest, \\nshoulders, triceps)\\n6-8 3 3-4 min\\nTuesday (back, biceps) 10-12 3 1-2 min\\nWednesday (legs) 8-10 3 3 min\\nThursday (chest, \\nshoulders, triceps)\\n10-12 3 1-2 min\\nFriday (back, biceps) 8-10 3 3 min\\nSaturday (legs) 12-15 3 <1 min\\nTABLE 3.6 Strong Cycle\\nWeek % 1RM Reps Sets\\n1 55% 5 5\\n2 60% 5 5\\n3 65% 5 5\\n4 70% 5 5\\n5 75% 5 5\\n6 85% 3 3\\n7 90% 3 3\\n8 95% 3 3\\n9 95% 2 2\\n10 100%* 2 2\\n11** – – –\\n*Based on previous max.\\n**Active rest.'),\n",

In addition, some novel \\npieces of strength training equipment do not fit \\ninto the standard categories, such as vibration. \\nThis chapter covers the more common forms of \\nstrength training equipment as well as some that \\nare not so common.\\nSIMPLE RESISTANCE\\nThe first category of strength training equipment \\nprovides constant resistance throughout the \\nentire range of motion. This is the simplest form \\nof resistance and is composed of little more than \\nobjects that provide weight. The mass of the \\nobject, whether it be a dumbbell or a weight stack, \\nprovides resistance through gravity. Any time you \\nattempt to pick up a free object, you are fighting \\nthe force of gravity, which pulls the object to the \\nground. The type of contraction that the muscle \\ngoes through when lifting a free object is termed \\nisotonic. It literally means same tone or tension, \\nbecause the weight stays the same while you lift \\nit. If the object is too heavy to move, the type of \\ncontraction the muscle goes through is isometric. \\nBecause the mass of any object can be used in \\nthis manner, this category of strength training \\nequipment is the largest and is composed of the \\nwidest range of equipment.\\nFree Weights\\nThe term free weights refers to equipment moved \\nin the performance of an exercise, which is simply \\nraised and lowered as a complete unit. It is called \\nfree weight because the weight is free to move in \\nany direction and in any manner. Technically, any \\nobject can be considered free weight; however, the \\nterm usually refers to the weight plates and barbell \\nor dumbbell systems and related items found in \\nhome and commercial gyms.\\nbarbell—The bar that weight plates are loaded \\nonto for purposes of strength training. Barbells \\nnormally measure between five and seven feet \\nin length, depending on the type of barbell. There \\nare several different types of barbells:\\nOlympic barbell—A special type of barbell used in \\nOlympic weightlifting and in powerlifting competi-\\ntions as well as in gyms (see figure 4.1). These \\nbars weigh 20 kilograms (just under 45 pounds) \\nand are seven feet in length. The ends of the \\nbar are two inches (five centimeters) in diame-\\nter to fit Olympic weight plates, and the handle \\nsection where you grab the bar is one inch (two \\nand a half centimeters) in diameter. Parts of the \\nhandle section are knurled for better gripping. \\nSome gyms have shorter versions of these bars.\\nFIGURE 4.1 Standard bar and plates (left) contrasted with \\nOlympic bar and plates (right).'),\n",

However, \\nthese barbells have ends that are one inch in \\ndiameter to fit standard weight plates.\\nfixed barbell— A barbell with a predetermined \\nweight (see figure 4.2).\\nFIGURE 4.2 Fixed barbells on a rack.\\nEZ curl bar— A special type of barbell that is \\nbent at several points so that it looks like a \\nstretched-out W (see figure 4.3). This allows \\nthe user to have a grip that is somewhere \\nbetween a fully supinated grip (underhand grip) \\nand a neutral grip. The purpose of this is to \\ntake stress off the wrists as well as place more \\nstress on the long head of the biceps (outer \\nbiceps). An EZ curl bar is occasionally called \\na cambered curling bar.\\nFIGURE 4.3 Curls with an EZ curl bar.\\nfat bar—A special barbell or dumbbell that is larger \\nin diameter on the gripping portion of the bar \\nthan the conventional bars that are one inch in \\ndiameter. Fat bars usually come in two-inch and \\nsometimes three-inch (five- or eight-centimeter) \\ndiameters. Training with fat bars allows users to \\ndevelop greater grip strength than they would by \\nusing a standard one-inch bar. However, research \\nhas shown that using fat bars on pulling exer -\\ncises, such as deadlifts, rows and curls can limit \\nthe weight used on those exercises, which could \\ninterfere with strength and muscle hypertrophy \\ngains of the target muscle.\\nsafety squat bar—A bar that resembles a barbell \\nwith two short padded bars (about 12 inches, \\nor 30 centimeters) that run perpendicular to the \\nbar from the middle. These padded bars rest on \\nthe shoulders and allow the user to grab them \\nas a handle while squatting (see figure 4.4).\\nFIGURE 4.4 Squatting with a safety squat bar.\\ntrap bar—A weight bar with a diamond-shaped or \\nhexagon section in the middle. During the exer-\\ncise, the lifter stands inside the diamond and \\ngrips the transverse handholds on either side \\nof the diamond. This type of bar is sometimes \\ncalled a hex bar, due to its shape, and is typically \\nused for shrugs and deadlifts (see figure 4.5).\\nFIGURE 4.5 Trap bar.'),\n",

These benches consist \\nof just the padded bench and leg supports and \\ninclude the following:\\nflat bench—A fixed horizontal bench that is used \\nfor seated or lying exercises that are performed \\nprone or supine.\\nadjustable-incline bench— A bench that allows \\nthe angle of the surface to be adjusted from \\nhorizontal to vertical with various points in \\nbetween.\\nadjustable-decline bench—A bench that angles \\ndown at varying degrees so that the head is \\nlower than the feet. This is often used for chest \\nand abdominal exercises.\\nlow-back bench— A bench that has a short \\nhorizontal seat and a low vertical back pad \\nto support the back during exercises such as \\noverhead presses and triceps extensions.\\nweight rack— A rack that supports a barbell to \\nallow the lifter to grab it from a variety of posi -\\ntions. The following are some types of weight \\nracks:\\npower rack— The most versatile rack is this \\nsafety apparatus that is made of four vertical \\nsteel beams to create a cage that is usually \\nabout five feet (one and a half meters) long, \\nfive feet wide, and seven feet (two meters) tall. \\nThe vertical beams have holes drilled into them \\nevery one to two inches from top to bottom. The \\nholes allow the barbell hooks to be adjusted \\nto different heights. The holes also fit safety \\nbars that can be used to catch the barbell if \\nthe lifter fails to lift the weight. Power racks are \\ntypically used for squats, shrugs, and presses \\n(see figure 4.11a).\\nsquat rack— A steel structure that has bar -\\nbell-support hooks at different heights so that \\nlifters of various statures can easily unrack \\nthe barbell to perform the squat or other \\nstanding exercises. Some squat racks have \\ntwo horizontal beams that are about three \\nfeet (91 centimeters) high and run parallel \\nto each other off the front of the squat rack. \\nThese beams act as a safety rack so that if \\na lifter fails to complete a squat, he or she \\ncan rack the weight on the safety beam (see \\nfigure 4.11b).\\na  \\n b\\nFIGURE 4.11 (a)  Squatting in a power rack contrasted with \\n(b) squatting in a squat rack.\\nstability objects—A multitude of objects can pro -\\nvide unstable support. Unlike a bench, which has \\na stable foundation to support the lifter’s body \\nweight, stability objects are unstable objects that \\nmake an exercise more difficult to perform. This \\nhelps to develop the strength of the core and \\nstabilizer muscles.\\nexercise ball— Also known as a stability ball. \\nThese inflatable balls come in several sizes \\n(30 to 85 centimeters in diameter). They offer a \\nplatform that rolls and gives when a person sits \\nor lies on it, making seated or lying exercises \\nwith dumbbells or barbells much more difficult'),\n",

Today, although balanced barbells and \\ndumbbells are available, some people use common \\nobjects (such as food cans or gallon milk jugs) when \\nthey don’t have access to standard free-weight imple-\\nments or choose to lift awkward and unbalanced \\nobjects (such as stones and beer kegs) to develop \\nmore functional strength. Obviously, any object with \\nmass can be used as a strength training tool—a can \\nof soup, a bucket of water, or a cement cylinder block. \\nRocks, logs, and tires are common implements to \\nbe lifted in strongman competitions. The disadvan-\\ntage to lifting common objects is the awkwardness. \\nWithout a clear handle to grab and without an even \\nbalance of weight, lifting common objects requires \\nmore functional ability than free weights require. But \\nlifting such awkward implements helps to develop \\ncore strength and functional strength.\\nstrongman implements—Strongmen are required \\nto lift a number of awkward objects during com-\\npetition. Most events combine strength and \\nmuscle endurance by requiring the competitors \\nto outdo each other by lifting such objects for \\nthe most repetitions or carrying them the most \\nquickly over a certain distance. Some common \\nstrongmen implements include the following:\\nAtlas stone—Atlas stones are large, heavy balls \\nmade of granite or concrete that strongmen \\nmust lift and carry in competition. Sizes range \\nfrom 14 inches to more than 60 inches (36 \\nto 152 centimeters) in diameter and weights \\nrange from about 140 pounds to well over 300 \\npounds (64 to 136 kilograms). Competitors \\ntypically must lift progressively heavier Atlas \\nstones from the ground and load them onto pro-\\ngressively higher pedestals (up to 60 inches). \\nThe competitor who completes the task in the \\nleast amount of time wins.'),\n",

The modified ones found in \\ncompetitions have handles carved into them for \\neasier gripping when lifting. These can range in \\nweight from about 200 to well over 300 pounds \\n(91 to 136 kilograms). The winner is the compet-\\nitor who lifts the heaviest log from the ground to \\noverhead.

The unique mass characteristics \\nof the object (unbalanced weight or progressive \\nweight) offer benefits that free weights don’t. \\nSuch implements include the following:\\nchains—Steel chains can be attached to an Olym-\\npic bar to provide progressive resistance during \\nbarbell exercises such as the bench press or \\nsquat. The unique thing about chains is that as \\neach link lifts off the ground, the weight being \\nlifted increases, offering linear variable resistance \\nthroughout the range of motion. This type of resis-\\ntance provides greater resistance the further you \\nmove through the range of motion of an exercise.\\nbeer keg—An empty beer keg weighs approxi -\\nmately 30 pounds (14 kilograms). The handles \\non a beer keg make it easy to grip, but the \\nrotund shape makes it awkward to lift and con-\\ntrol. Some strength coaches have their football, \\nbasketball, baseball, and hockey players as well \\nas other athletes lift kegs as a way to develop \\nmore functional strength.\\neveryday objects—Objects that are found in most \\nhomes can be used in place of free weights \\nwhen free weights are unavailable for standard \\nstrength training exercises. Some objects com-\\nmonly used include the following:\\nsoup cans—These can range in weight from 10 \\nounces to a little over 1 pound (.28 to .45 kilo-\\ngram). Similar to dumbbells, soup cans can be \\nheld in the hands for almost any exercise that \\nwould normally be performed with dumbbells. \\nBecause of the limit in weight available, cans \\nare best suited for people with poor strength \\nor for those performing workouts that have very \\nhigh reps.\\ngallon jugs—Plastic gallon jugs weigh about 8 \\npounds (4 kilograms) when filled with fluid or 14 \\npounds (6 kilograms) when filled with sand. The \\nhandles allow them to be gripped in a fashion \\nsimilar to that of dumbbells (although they’re \\nmore awkward to lift). The weight can be adjusted \\nby altering the amount of fluid or sand in the jugs.\\nHuman Body\\nYour own body weight or that of a training partner \\ncan be used as a form of resistance.\\nown body weight— Exercises such as push-\\nups, chin-ups, dips, body-weight squats, and \\ncrunches use pure body weight, nothing else, \\nto get the job done (see figure 4.16).\\nFIGURE 4.16 Dips.\\npartner body weight—When training with a partner, \\nyou can do a variety of exercises that use the \\npartner’s body weight as resistance.

They can also be used for leg raises for \\nthe abdominals and for a variety of other exer-\\ncises. Some dipping bars are angled inward at \\none end so that the distance between the two \\nbars is different. This allows you to perform \\ndips with varying grip width.\\nvertical bench— This device is composed of a \\nlong, vertical, padded bench that is attached \\nto a metal platform that has handles and arm-\\nrests. The lifter suspends the body by support-\\ning the weight with the forearms and pressing \\nthe back against the pad. This bench is used for \\nleg raises (see figure 4.18) and is sometimes \\nreferred to as a captain’s chair. Some vertical \\nbenches have dip bars extended off the front.\\nFIGURE 4.18 Knee raises on a vertical bench.\\nback extension bench— A high, short, padded \\nbench that has leg pads set at the same height \\nas the bench. This allows the lifter to lie prone \\nwith the pelvis resting on the padded bench \\nand the feet secured under the leg pads while \\ndoing back extensions.\\nSuspension trainer— The TRX is responsible for \\nmaking suspension training popular. But long \\nbefore TRX, chains or ropes with handles were \\nused. Today there are numerous other suspen-\\nsion trainer brands that have followed in the \\nfootsteps of TRX. Suspension training involves \\nstraps, often made of canvas or nylon that sus-\\npend part of the body (usually from the arms or \\nfeet) to allow the person’s own body to provide \\nresistance. For example, you can do inverted \\nrows using a suspension trainer to work the lats \\n(see figure 4.19).\\nFIGURE 4.19 Inverted rows on a TRX.\\nSimple Weight Machines\\nSimple weight machines are those machines and \\napparatuses that provide a constant level of resis-\\ntance throughout the entire range of motion.

There is a seat for a lifter \\nto sit in while placing the feet on the sled (see \\nfigure 4.21). After the lifter disengages the \\nsafety bar, the sled is free to move up and down \\nthe linear guide rod. However, the natural arc of \\nmotion of the legs in that position is curvilinear \\n(a combination of a curve and a straight line). \\nThis has prompted some manufacturers of \\nweight machines to design leg press machines \\nthat follow a curvilinear path. This more natural \\nmotion places less stress on the knees.\\nFIGURE 4.21 The leg press.\\nhack squat—This machine for leg exercises is \\nsimilar to the leg press except that the lifter \\nstands rather than sits. A padded sled rides \\nalong two guide rods that are angled at about \\n50 to 80 degrees. The lifter stands in the hack \\nsquat with the back against the padded sled \\nand the shoulders under the shoulder pads. \\nAfter disengaging the safety bars, the lifter \\nsquats down and back up, allowing the sled \\nto follow.\\nCable Pulley Machines\\nCable pulley machines refer to exercise machines \\nthat are based on a simple system of cables and \\npulleys. In their most basic form they consist of a \\ncable that routes through a pulley (or several pul-\\nleys) and connects to a weight stack. A pulley is a \\nfreely rotating wheel used to change the direction \\nof force applied by a cable. This allows for force to \\nbe applied to a muscle in a variety of directions, \\nsuch as horizontal. A weight stack is a stack of \\nspecialized weight plates (usually rectangular in \\nshape and weighing 5 to 20 pounds each) that \\nare fixed so that they can slide vertically on the \\nguide rods of a weight machine. Each weight plate \\nis drilled with a horizontal hole that allows a pin \\nto be placed through the plate. This weight and all \\nthose above it may then be lifted by the moveable \\nrod, which is typically attached to a cable or lever \\narm. When tension is placed on the cable (that \\nis, the cable is pulled), the weight stack is lifted \\nalong its guide rods, thereby supplying resistance. \\nSome home machines, such as Bowflex, use flex-\\nible rods for resistance instead of a weight stack. \\nCables offer a number of benefits to weightlifters. \\nBecause the cable can be pulled in a number \\nof directions, it offers constant tension on the \\nmuscle throughout the entire range of motion \\n(see figure 4.22).\\nFIGURE 4.22 The cable crossover.'),\n",

It includes machines that purposely vary the \\nresistance throughout the range of motion and \\nequipment that varies the resistance throughout \\nthe range of motion in an uncontrolled fashion.\\nCam-Based Resistance Machines\\nCam-based resistance machines are the type of \\nweight machines found in most gyms. They are \\noften called selectorized machines because of the \\nweight stack that is on most of these machines. \\nHowever, some cam-based machines are plate \\nloaded. The most popular brands are Cybex, Life \\nFitness, Nautilus, PreCor, Hoist, and Paramount.\\nThe cam is an ellipse connected to the move -\\nment arm of the machine on which the cable \\nor belt travels. The purpose of the cam is to \\nprovide variable resistance, which changes how \\nheavy the weight feels (but the actual weight \\nnever changes) as the lifter moves through the \\nrange of motion of the exercise. The reason \\nthe perception of the weight needs to change \\nis that each joint movement has an associated \\nstrength curve. That is, at different angles of the \\njoint the strength of the agonist muscle varies. \\nFor example, during a biceps curl, the strength \\nof the agonist muscles (mainly the biceps) pro -\\ngressively gets stronger up to about 90 degrees \\nof bend at the elbow. After that, the strength \\nprogressively decreases as the curl continues. \\nThis is known as an ascending and descending \\nstrength curve.\\nThere are three types of strength curves and, \\ntherefore, three basic cam shapes that correspond \\nto each strength curve:\\nascending and descending curve— This type \\nof strength curve was described previously \\nwith the biceps curl as an example. In this \\ntype of curve the strength increases up to \\nabout the halfway point of the movement and \\nthen decreases through the rest of the move-\\nment. For this reason it is often referred to \\nas bell shaped. The shape of the ascending \\nand descending cam is similar to a bell or an \\ninverted U with the largest radius in the middle \\n(see figure 4.30a).\\nascending curve— In the ascending curve the \\nstrength progressively increases through the \\nentire range of motion. An example of this is \\nthe bench press. The farther the weight moves \\naway from the chest, the stronger the agonist \\nmuscles are. The shape of the ascending cam \\nis oblong with the largest radius at the distal \\nend (see figure 4.30b).\\ndescending curve—In the descending curve the \\nstrength progressively decreases through the \\nentire range of motion. This type of strength \\ncurve can be experienced during the row \\nexercise. As the handles are pulled closer to \\nthe body, the strength of the agonist muscles \\ndecreases. The shape of the descending cam \\nis oblong with the largest radius at the proximal \\nend (see figure 4.30c).'),\n",

Therefore, much like \\ncam-based machines, the counterbalanced lever \\narms vary the resistance throughout the range of \\nmotion by altering the amount of weight that coun-\\nterbalances the weight being moved. These are \\nusually plate-loaded machines; however, some of \\nthem use a weight stack system. The most popular \\nline of lever-arm resistance machines is Hammer \\nStrength by Life Fitness (see figure 4.31).\\nFIGURE 4.31 A Hammer Strength chest press.\\nResistance With Pull\\nSome exercise devices don’t rely on mass for resis-\\ntance but on the energy their material supplies. \\nSprings, bands, and other material that resist being \\npulled are such devices. These devices provide \\nonly ascending resistance, because the resistance \\nprogressively increases over the range of motion.\\nSprings\\nThe force generated by a spring is a restoring force, \\nwhich attempts to move the two attachment points \\nback to their original resting positions when they \\nare either pulled farther apart or pushed closer \\ntogether. The force a spring supplies depends \\non its material and the diameter of its coils. The \\ndistance the spring is pulled or compressed also \\nchanges the force, because the farther the ends \\nare moved away from their original position, the \\nmore force they will supply. This is known as the \\nspring rate—the rate at which tension increases \\nas the ends move. This characteristic makes it \\nimpossible to maintain a particular resistance level \\nover the movement of the exercise.\\nAs the spring is deflected, resistance goes up; \\nas it is relaxed, resistance goes down. Because \\nof spring rate, users are forced to select a resis -\\ntance that will be within their strength capability at \\nmaximum deflection, or they won’t be able to do \\nthe exercise movement at all. As a result, during \\nthe first 50 percent or more of the movement, \\nresistance is often too low to produce much bene-\\nfit. Spring-resistance exercise devices come in a \\nvariety of setups. These include simple handheld \\ndevices that were popular in the 1950s, such as \\nthe Bull Worker, Chest Expander, and Grip Master \\n(see figure 4.32). Although strength training has \\nprogressed far beyond spring resistance, some \\nspring devices are still being used in certain \\nproducts such as hand grippers (see figure 4.33), \\nPilates exercise machines, and the Stamina Gyro-\\ntonics spring-resistance exercise machine.\\nc\\na\\n b\\nFIGURE 4.30 Types of cam machines: (a) ascending and descending cam, (b) ascending cam, and (c) descending cam.'),\n",

However, the force is \\napplied only when the ends of the material are \\nbeing pulled away from one another. Like springs, \\nelastic bands and tubing have a spring rate. That \\nis, as they are lengthened, the resistance they \\nprovide increases (see figure 4.34). This type of \\nresistance is known as linear variable resistance \\nand provides numerous benefits that free weights \\ncannot. Because the resistance gets harder as you \\npull the bands, it is great for targeting the fast-\\ntwitch muscle fibers and developing greater muscle \\npower. Because they are lightweight and portable, \\nbands and tubing allow exercisers to work out at \\nhome or while away from home. They can also \\nbe added to free weights to provide both isotonic \\nresistance from the free weights and the linear \\nvariable resistance from the bands. Research \\nshows that this method can produce superior \\ngains in muscle strength and power than using free \\nweights alone. Bands and tubes are color coded \\nto represent a certain resistance level. See table \\n4.1 for color and resistance codes.\\nTABLE 4.1 Tube and Band Resistance\\nBand or tube color Resistance level\\nYellow Extra light\\nGreen Light\\nRed Medium\\nBlue Heavy\\nBlack Extra heavy\\nOrange Extra, extra heavy\\nResistance levels are measured at 100 percent elongation and \\ntwice the unstretched length. They should not be stretched beyond \\nthis point.\\nSPEED MACHINES\\nThis category of strength training equipment deals \\nwith machines that control the rate of speed of \\nmovement. The type of muscle contraction where \\nthe speed remains constant is considered iso -\\nkinetic. Equipment that controls the speed of move-\\nment provides resistance simply by moving through \\na range of motion at a particular set speed while the \\nlifter applies as much force as possible to the lever \\narm without altering the speed at which the lever \\narm moves. Because the lever arm must be moved \\nat a controlled, constant rate, the machines that \\nprovide this type of resistance—known as isokinetic \\ndynamometers—are controlled by a computer.\\nisokinetic dynamometer— This computerized \\nresistance machine can be programmed to \\nmove at a variety of set speeds. These are \\ncommonly found only in laboratory settings or \\nsports medicine clinics as a tool for measuring \\nthe amount of force that an athlete can apply. \\nThis type of equipment is usually interfaced \\nwith a computer to not only control the rate of \\nspeed of the movement but to measure force \\napplied as well.

The other disadvantage of \\nisokinetic dynamometers is that no isokinetic \\nmuscle actions actually occur in real-life \\nmovements.\\nNONTRADITIONAL AND NEW \\nAPPARATUS\\nThe last category of strength training equipment \\ncovers equipment that is typically not categorized \\namong the other more common forms of strength \\ntraining equipment. These devices include vibra -\\ntion machines, electronic and computerized resis-\\ntance machines, pneumatic resistance machines, \\nhydraulic resistance machines, and the Bodyblade. \\nCommon to them all is the fact that the way they \\nprovide resistance is novel.\\nVibration Machines\\nWhole-body vibration machines usually consist \\nof a device that the user can stand, lie, sit, or \\nplace the hands or any other part of the body on \\nto transmit vibration to the body tissues the user \\nwishes to stimulate (see figure 4.35). Most of \\nthese vibration machines are about the size of a \\ntypical stair stepper, and the vibration platform is \\nabout 32 inches by 20 inches (81 by 51 centime-\\nters). The control panel allows the user to change \\nthe speed (or frequency) and the magnitude of \\nthe vibration.\\nFIGURE 4.35 Vibration machine.\\nMost machines have vibration plates that move \\nup and down and side to side, while others work \\nas a high-speed wobble board. The energy from the \\nmechanical vibration (of the plate) is transferred \\nthrough the body, causing the muscle fibers to \\ncontract and relax at an extremely rapid rate and \\nwith very high force. Research shows that per -\\nforming vibration training for several weeks can \\nincrease muscle strength and power (Issurin and \\nTenenbaum 1999) as well as increase the release \\nof growth hormone and testosterone, which are \\nanabolic hormones (Bosco et al. 2000). Although \\nmost people cannot understand how vibration can \\nbe considered a method of strength training, it is \\nslowly being recognized for its ability to increase \\nstrength, power, and possibly muscle growth.\\nElectronic and Computerized \\nResistance Machines\\nElectronic and computerized machines provide \\nresistance through gears and belts connected to \\na motor. These are programmed to provide variable \\nresistance throughout the range of motion to follow \\nthe strength curve of the muscle being trained. \\nResistance can be increased in increments as \\nsmall as one pound through a touch screen, \\nbutton, or foot pedal. Some machines can be \\nprogrammed to provide greater resistance during \\nthe eccentric portion of the exercise.\\nPneumatic Resistance Machines\\nPneumatic resistance machines use a compressor \\nto supply air pressure for resistance. This allows \\nthe lifter to adjust the resistance on his or her own \\nthroughout the range of motion (see figure 4.36). \\nThe benefit of this is that as the muscles fatigue \\nduring a set, the resistance can be reduced to \\nallow more reps to be completed.\\nFIGURE 4.36 Pneumatic machine.'),\n",

Some exercisers do not \\nlike electronic or pneumatic equipment, however, \\nbecause they don’t provide the feel of lifting an \\nactual weight stack, dumbbell, or barbell. These \\nmodalities also can be more expensive than other \\nstrength training equipment, and they require \\nspecial wiring for electricity or a layout to accom-\\nmodate an air compressor and hoses.\\nBecause of their uniqueness and ability to \\nsuit any population, electronic and pneumatic \\nmachines can be an excellent investment and pro-\\nvide variety in strength training for all exercisers.\\nHydraulic Resistance Machines\\nHydraulic resistance machines provide resis -\\ntance through hydraulics. The lever arm on these \\nmachines is connected to a hydraulic piston that \\nprovides resistance against the oil-filled chamber \\nit resides in. The problem with hydraulic resistance \\nmachines is that they allow for concentric contrac-\\ntions only. Therefore, most hydraulic machines \\ntrain dual muscles but only through the concentric \\nportion. For instance, the hydraulic biceps machine \\nis a biceps–triceps machine because after the user \\ncurls the weight up, he or she must press it back \\ndown using the triceps muscles.\\nBodyblade\\nBodyblade, shown in figure 4.37, is a five-foot-long \\nfiberglass beam that resembles a snow ski and \\nworks by the laws of inertia (an object set in motion \\nremains in motion until another force acts on it to \\nstop or change its direction). The user holds the \\nmiddle of it and pushes and pulls on the apparatus \\nto start it oscillating. During use, it oscillates at \\nan average rate of about 270 times per minute. \\nThese oscillations in the ends of the blade create \\na force that the holder must resist to literally keep \\nit from flying out of the hands. With each oscillation \\nthe muscles of the arms and core must resist the \\nmovement by contracting. The greater the ampli -\\ntude of the blade ends (the farther they flex up and \\ndown), the more force the user must apply to resist \\nthe movement. By varying the positions of the body \\nor direction of the flexing blade, the user can target \\nspecific muscle groups throughout the body. Since \\nthe blade can be used at any angle and position, \\na major benefit to this piece of equipment is that \\nit can mimic the movements in a particular sport \\nand provide the required specificity of training. The \\ndisadvantage of the Bodyblade is the fact that it \\nis limited mainly to upper-body and core exercises \\nwith little application for the lower-body muscles.\\nFIGURE 4.37 Bodyblade.\\nSUMMARY\\nStrength training equipment has developed over \\nthe decades from simple free weights to complex \\nmachinery that provide resistance through novel \\nmechanisms. This, however, is not to say that the \\nmore modern equipment is better than the sim -\\nplest form of free weights. In fact, free weights \\nhave many advantages and very few disadvan -\\ntages. Modern resistance machines, on the other \\nhand, tend to have many more disadvantages \\nthan free weight equipment. Because all forms of \\nstrength training equipment offer different advan-\\ntages and are limited by different disadvantages, \\nit is best to use a variety of training equipment in \\nyour strength training program.'),\n",

While \\nadvanced training techniques—like those described \\nin chapter 6—can help you rapidly advance muscle \\ngains, you must first understand how to organize a \\nbasic training program. This chapter demonstrates \\nhow to put together a basic yet highly effective pro-\\ngram that you can build on later with more advanced \\ntraining methods as you progress.\\nIf your primary goal is to build muscle mass, \\nthen you must consider several things when struc-\\nturing your strength training program. You will need \\nto consider the variables discussed in chapter 2. \\nThese include the choice of exercises you will per-\\nform, the order of those exercises, how many sets \\nof each exercise you will do, how heavy a weight \\nyou will use on those exercises, how much rest \\nyou will allow between sets, and even how fast or \\nslow your reps are. You will also need to consider \\nhow often you will train each muscle group, how \\nyou will split up your training, and how you will \\nperiodize (or cycle) your training for optimal results.\\nWEEKLY SPLITS\\nMost weightlifters break their training down into \\na weekly period. While this isn’t a necessity, it \\nseems to be the simplest approach to split up \\ntraining days because our calendar revolves \\naround a weekly schedule. All other activities in \\nour lives—school, work, television programs, and \\nleisure activities—all follow a weekly schedule. It’s \\nonly logical to break your strength training down \\ninto a similar period. How you split your training will \\ninfluence how often you train each muscle group \\nper week. Choosing a training split that is the most \\nadvantageous for you depends on several factors, \\nsuch as your training experience, your overall goals, \\nyour schedule, and even convenience.\\nThe following seven training splits are the most \\ncommon and effective for the majority of bodybuild-\\ners. These splits start with the easiest (whole-body \\ntraining) split for beginners (those with less than \\nsix months of consistent strength training) and pro-\\ngressively become more intense as they advance \\nthrough push–pull training splits and two-day train-\\ning splits, which are ideal for intermediate lifters \\n(those with less than one year of consistent strength \\ntraining) and end with five-day training splits and \\ntwice-a-day training splits, which are geared for the \\nadvanced lifter (those with over a year of consis -\\ntent strength training). Choosing the right split will \\ndepend primarily on your training experience, but you \\nshould also take into consideration your schedule.\\nWhole-Body Training\\nWhole-body training refers to single workouts that \\nstress every major muscle group. In other words, \\nthe entire body is trained in every workout. Because \\nyou will need to train up to 11 major muscle groups \\n(chest, shoulders, back, quadriceps, hamstrings, \\nbiceps, triceps, forearms, trapezius, calves, and \\nabdominals) in each workout, the number of \\nexercises and sets you can do per muscle group \\nis minimal. This allows you to train each muscle \\ngroup more frequently because it receives a lim -\\nited amount of stress at each workout. Typically, \\nmost whole-body training workouts use one or two \\nexercises per muscle group, and total sets per \\nmuscle group rarely exceed six. Compare this to the \\nfour-day and five-day training splits, which allow the \\nweightlifter to hit three to six exercises and a total'),\n",

The fewer total \\nsets a muscle group receives, the less recuperation \\nit usually needs before being trained again.\\nWhole-body training splits allow you to train each \\nmuscle group about three times per week. This type \\nof training split is best for beginning weightlifters \\n(those with up to six months of training experience), \\nthose who want to train each muscle group more \\nfrequently, and those who are interested in cutting \\ndown on body fat. The reason whole-body training is \\nthe best choice for beginners is that the initial adap-\\ntations made in a strength training program involve \\nthe nervous system. That is, in the first few months \\nof strength training, the primary improvements are \\nseen in the motor units (the nerve fibers that serve \\nthe muscle cells). These improvements allow the \\nmuscles to contract more efficiently and are best \\ntrained by repetition. This means that the best \\nway for beginners to train is with high repetitions \\nand more frequent training to program the nervous \\nsystem. They should use the same exercises in each \\nworkout to maximize the learning effect that will have \\nthe greatest benefit on the nervous system.\\nWhole-body training is effective for building \\nmuscle mass for two reasons. The first benefit \\nis known as the staircase effect. Training each \\nmuscle group every other day (or about three days \\nper week) allows you to build onto the effects of \\nthe previous workout. If you wait too long between \\nworkouts, you’re back to square one—almost as if \\nyou are starting over from the original point. Some \\nexperts believe that the staircase effect is critical \\nto muscle adaptation. The second benefit to whole-\\nbody training is that it stimulates a large portion \\nof the body’s muscle mass. This leads to higher \\nproduction of growth hormone and testosterone \\n(important for stimulating muscle growth) than \\nworkouts that train fewer muscle groups. If you are \\nan advanced weightlifter, the best way to use whole-\\nbody training is to mix up the exercises at every \\nworkout. This allows you to hit each muscle group \\nfrom a variety of angles for better stimulation of the \\nmajority of muscle fibers within each muscle group.\\nWhen it comes to shedding body fat, no workout \\nsplit is more conducive to that goal than whole-\\nbody training. Training all the major muscle groups \\nrevs up cellular processes in all the muscle cells, \\nwhich increases the metabolic rate for up to 48 \\nhours after the workout is over. This means you \\nwill burn more calories while sitting around doing \\nnothing.

Dividing the \\nbody into three separate workouts allows you to \\nfurther increase the volume that is typically used in \\nwhole-body training, upper- and lower-body training, \\nand two-day training splits. This type of split allows \\nyou to give each muscle group three to seven days \\nof rest between workouts. Most bodybuilders using \\nthis system train each muscle group either once \\nor twice per week. When training muscle groups \\njust once per week, the typical three-day training \\nsplit is done on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, as \\nshown in table 5.5.

This allows you to train fewer muscle groups \\neach workout. By training fewer muscle groups per \\nworkout, you can increase the volume and intensity \\nof your workouts. Both of these factors are important \\nfor continued progress as your training experience \\ngrows. Most four-day training splits are done on a \\nMonday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday schedule, \\nand rest days are taken on Wednesday, Saturday, \\nand Sunday. A common way to break up the body’s \\nmuscle groups is by training chest, triceps, and \\nabdominals on Mondays; quadriceps, hamstrings, \\nand calves on Tuesdays; shoulders, trapezius, and \\nabdominals on Thursdays; and back, biceps, and \\nforearms on Friday, as covered in table 5.6.\\nThe four-day training split pairs larger muscle \\ngroups with smaller ones that assist the larger \\nmuscle groups, such as chest with triceps. The \\ntriceps assist the chest muscles (pectorals) in \\nall pressing exercises such as the bench press. \\nThe logic behind this technique is that the chest \\nworkout also works the triceps muscles. With \\nthis in mind, it makes sense to continue with \\nexercises that further target the triceps. This is \\nthe same with pairing back, biceps, and forearms \\nas well as quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves. \\nAlong this line of reasoning, you could also pair \\nchest with shoulders and trapezius because \\nthe shoulder (deltoid) muscles assist the chest \\nduring all exercises that target the chest. The \\nmost important rule here is that larger muscle \\ngroups are trained before the smaller muscle \\ngroups that assist them, because if you train the \\nsmaller muscle groups first, they will be fatigued \\nwhen you are training the larger muscle group and \\nwill limit strength on the exercises for the larger \\nmuscle group.\\nTHURSDAY\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nShoulders Barbell shoulder press 3 8-10\\nLateral raise 3 10-12\\nFront raise 2 10-12\\nStanding cable reverse \\nfly\\n2 10-12\\nTrapezius Barbell behind-the-back \\nshrug\\n4 8-10\\nAbdominals Hip thrust 3 12-15\\nCable crunch 3 12-15\\nFRIDAY\\nBack Wide-grip pulldown to \\nfront\\n3 8-10\\nOne-arm dumbbell row 3 8-10\\nT-bar row 3 8-10\\nReverse-grip pulldown 3 10-12\\nBiceps EZ bar curl 3 8-10\\nDumbbell concentra-\\ntion curl\\n3 10-12\\nAlternating hammer \\ncurl\\n3 8-10\\nForearms Dumbbell wrist curl 3 10-12\\nReverse wrist curl 3 10-12\\nTABLE 5.6 Four-Day Training Split for Pairing Like Muscle Groups\\nMONDAY\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nChest Incline bench press 3 8-10\\nDumbbell bench press 3 8-10\\nIncline dumbbell fly 3 10-12\\nCable crossover 3 10-12\\nTriceps Triceps dip 3 6-10\\nLying triceps extension 3 8-10\\nOverhead rope \\nextension\\n3 10-12\\nAbdominals Hanging leg raise 3 10-12\\nCrunch 3 15-20\\nTUESDAY\\nQuadriceps Smith machine squat 4 8-10\\nLunge 3 8-10\\nLeg extension 3 10-12\\nHamstrings Lying leg curl 3 10-12\\nRomanian deadlift 3 8-10\\nCalves Standing calf raise 3 10-12\\nSeated calf raise 3 12-15'),\n",

On the flip side of pairing muscle \\ngroups that work together is the concept of sep -\\narating muscle groups that work together. The \\nreasoning for this is that the smaller muscle group \\nis often fatigued after training the larger muscle \\ngroup. This will limit the strength of the smaller \\nmuscle group and cause it to fatigue earlier when \\ndoing exercises that target it. This in turn can limit \\ngrowth of that muscle. The option here would be to \\nsplit up the muscle groups into those that perform \\nopposite actions. For example, on Monday train \\nchest and back; Tuesday train shoulders, trape -\\nzius, and abdominals; Thursday train quadriceps, \\nhamstrings, and calves; and Friday train biceps, \\ntriceps, forearms, and abdominals, as shown in \\ntable 5.7. The Monday and Friday workouts best \\nexemplify this training strategy. Training chest \\nand back allows you to train two muscle groups \\nthat don’t fatigue each other. The same can be \\nsaid for training biceps and triceps together. Each \\nmuscle group performs an opposite motion of its \\ntraining pair. The biceps flex the elbow while the \\ntriceps extend it. Not only does this help to prevent \\nfatigue of the second muscle group trained, but it \\ncan also enhance muscle strength, as explained \\nin chapter 9, with the technique known as \\nfront-\\nto-back training.\\nTHURSDAY\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nQuadriceps Squat 3 6-8\\nLeg press 3 8-10\\nStep-up 3 8-10\\nLeg extension 3 10-12\\nHamstrings Standing leg curl 3 10-12\\nCalves Smith machine calf \\nraise\\n3 10-12\\nSeated calf raise 3 12-15\\nFRIDAY\\nBiceps Alternating dumbbell \\ncurl\\n3 8-10\\nLying cable curl 3 8-10\\nDumbbell preacher curl 3 8-10\\nForearms Reverse-grip curl 3 10-12\\nBehind-the-back wrist \\ncurl\\n3 10-12\\nTriceps Close-grip bench press 3 6-10\\nTriceps pressdown 3 8-10\\nOne-arm overhead \\ndumbbell extension\\n3 10-12\\nAbdominals Exercise-ball crunch 3 10-12\\nReverse crunch 3 12-15\\nTABLE 5.7 Four-Day Training Split for Pairing Opposite Muscle Groups\\nMONDAY\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nChest Smith machine bench \\npress\\n3 8-10\\nIncline dumbbell press 8-10\\nDumbbell fly 3 10-12\\nPec deck 3 10-12\\nBack Pull-up 3 6-10\\nReverse-grip barbell row 3 6-8\\nSeated cable row 3 8-10\\nWide-grip pulldown 3 10-12\\nTUESDAY\\nShoulders Dumbbell shoulder \\npress\\n3 8-10\\nSmith machine upright \\nrow\\n3 8-10\\nOne-arm cable lateral \\nraise\\n3 10-12\\nBent-over lateral raise 3 10-12\\nTrapezius Barbell shrug 4 6-8\\nAbdominals Incline sit-up 3 12-15\\nOblique crunch 3 12-15'),\n",

Typi-\\ncally, most bodybuilders who train twice a day train \\none muscle group earlier in the day and one muscle \\ngroup later in the day (see table 5.9). The break \\nbetween the two training sessions usually is at least \\nsix hours. Depending on your goal, this allows you \\nto either train more frequently or get more complete \\nrest days. With twice-a-day training you can train \\nall the major muscle groups of the body in three or \\nfour days. This means you can get either three or \\nfour days of rest each week if you train the muscle \\ngroups once per week. However, this method also \\nallows you to train each muscle group up to twice \\nper week. Another way to use twice-a-day training \\nis to follow a typical five-day training split that \\nincorporates a not-so-typical twist: train the same \\nmuscle group twice per day.

The training split you use will influence fac-\\ntors such as the number of exercises you perform \\nand the total number of sets you do per muscle \\ngroup. But generally speaking, your training split \\ndoes not have to influence the type of exercises \\nyou choose, the amount of weight used, the number \\nof reps performed, or the amount of rest you allow \\nbetween sets. Therefore, there are general rules \\nto consider when designing a strength training \\nprogram, regardless of the spilt you are employing.\\nIf your goal is to maximize muscle mass, then \\nyour most important rule has to deal with taking \\nall sets to muscle failure. Although the sweet \\nspot for muscle growth is said to be in the range \\nof 8 to 12 reps, newer research from McMaster \\nUniversity in Canada suggests that the amount \\nof weight and rep range used may not matter \\nas much as once proposed as long as sets are \\ntaken to muscle failure. One of their studies \\nreported that participants training for 10 weeks \\nusing weights that allowed them to complete 20 \\nto 30 reps and taking each set to muscle failure \\ngained as much muscle mass as those training \\nwith weights that limited them to 8 to 12 reps per \\nset and taking each set to muscle failure (Burd \\net al. 2010). Other studies done by this group \\ndemonstrate that the higher rep ranges (20-30) \\nwith light weight taken to muscle failure increase \\nmuscle protein synthesis to an equivalent amount \\nor even better than lower rep ranges (4-5 reps) \\ntaken to muscle failure (Burd et al. 2011). So \\nthe smartest plan of attack is to cycle through a \\nvariety of rep ranges from very low (3-5 per set) \\nwith heavy weight to very high (20-30+ per set) \\nwith light weight, and a multitude of rep ranges \\nin between, such as 6 to 8 per set, 9 to 11 per \\nset, and 12 to 15 per set. This way you get the \\nbenefit that each rep range imparts, aside from \\nthe direct influence on muscle protein synthesis. \\nFor example, heavier-weight workouts have been \\nshown to increase testosterone levels higher \\nthan workouts with lighter weight. Testosterone \\nis an anabolic hormone that initiates the process \\nof muscle growth. However, higher reps, such as \\n15 or more, are associated with a higher rate of \\nrelease of growth hormone compared to workouts \\ninvolving heavier weight. Because growth hor -\\nmone is involved in muscle growth, maximizing \\nits release after a workout can be critical. Higher \\nreps also enhance the capillarization of muscle \\nfibers. That is, the amount of blood vessels that \\nsupply the muscles increases with higher-repeti -\\ntion training. By increasing the number of blood \\nvessels that supply a muscle fiber, there is an \\naccompanying increase in the delivery of blood \\nto the muscle fibers. Enhancing blood flow to \\nthe muscle fibers increases the supply of critical \\nnutrients for energy and growth such as carbohy-\\ndrate, amino acids from protein, and fat. There \\nalso is greater provision of oxygen. Oxygen not \\nonly is essential for muscle energy for recovery \\nbetween sets but is also critical for lessening the \\nindirect muscle damage that follows a weightlift-\\ning workout. Another benefit of increased blood \\nflow to muscle fibers is the greater supply of \\nanabolic hormones, such as testosterone and \\ngrowth hormone, to the muscles.\\nThe order in which you cycle the rep ranges \\nmay not be critical. Periodized models using linear \\nschemes, reverse linear schemes, and undulating \\nschemes have all been effective in producing \\nmuscle growth. So a variety of periodized programs \\nthat cycle a variety of rep ranges but take each \\nworking set to failure appear to be the best tactic \\nfor focusing on muscle growth.\\nAnother important consideration for building \\nmuscle mass is the rest time allowed between \\nsets. Most bodybuilders use shorter rest periods \\nof around one to two minutes. Shorter rest peri -\\nods—those that are two minutes or less—have \\nalso been shown to increase the surge of growth \\nhormone that follows a weightlifting workout. \\nShorter rest periods also increase the capillariza-\\ntion of the muscles as well as enhance the activity \\nof enzymes that are involved in energy supply to \\nthe muscle. One study reported that participants \\nfollowing an eight-week strength-training program \\nwho decreased the rest period between sets by 15 \\nseconds every week had greater gains in muscle \\nmass than those keeping rest periods steady at \\n2 minutes (Souza-Junior et al. 2011). See chapter \\n6 for programs that decrease rest period between \\nsets over time.\\nExercise selection and order of those exer -\\ncises are other important things to consider for \\nbuilding muscle mass. For larger muscle groups \\nthat employ several multijoint exercises, such as'),\n",

Then \\nfollow those exercises with isolation exercises \\nthat involve movement at one single joint and best \\nisolate the targeted muscle group. The reason for \\nthis is that multijoint exercises recruit the help of \\nother muscle groups to perform the exercise. The \\ntargeted muscle group of that exercise is consid-\\nered the primary mover, while the muscle groups \\nthat help the primary mover perform the exercise \\nare considered assistance muscles. An example \\nof this is the bench press, a multijoint exercise \\nfor the chest. In the bench press, the chest is \\nconsidered the primary mover while the shoulders, \\ntriceps, and even the lats are considered the \\nassistance muscles. Because multijoint exercises \\ninvolve synergy of several muscle groups, you can \\nlift more weight with multijoint exercises. It is a \\ngood idea to do the exercises that you can lift \\nthe most weight with first. This is when all the \\nmuscles used in that exercise are freshest and \\ntherefore can all help to lift the greatest amount \\nof weight they are capable of lifting. Using more \\nweight places more overload on the target mus -\\ncles, which can lead to increased muscle hyper -\\ntrophy over time. All that said, on occasion it’s \\na good idea to flip this rule on its head and use \\nthe training technique known as preexhaust. With \\nthis technique you do the single-joint exercises \\nfor a muscle group first in the workout and the \\nmultijoint exercises last. For more on preexhaust \\nand why it works and to see a program that uses \\nit, go to chapter 6.\\nFor gains in strength, the general consensus \\namong experts is that fewer sets tend to be \\nbest. But there is some debate over the ideal \\nvolume—or total sets—to use for optimizing \\ngains in muscle mass. One reason may be that \\nthere is no ideal number of sets for increasing \\nmuscle mass. In general, beginners should start \\nout with fewer sets and gradually increase them \\nas their training experience progresses. But when \\nyou consider experienced bodybuilders, there are \\nfew generalizations that can be made in regard \\nto volume. Some bodybuilders train with very low \\nvolume (6 to 10 total sets per muscle group), while \\nothers use extremely high volume (20 to 30 total \\nsets per muscle group), as did the most famous \\nbodybuilder of all time, Arnold Schwarzenegger. \\nOne bit of advice for advanced lifters is to cycle \\ntraining volume from periods of low volume to high \\nvolume. This will depend on the training intensity \\nas well as the training frequency.\\nJust remember that these are general guidelines \\nfor building a solid foundation for your training pro-\\ngram. Many of the methods you will read about in \\nchapter 6 contradict these guidelines. The reason \\nis that the techniques presented in chapter 6 are \\ntechniques for those with moderate to extensive \\ntraining experience. For experienced lifters, chang-\\ning the convention from time to time better enables \\nmuscle growth because of the radical change in \\nthe training program.\\nChanging Your Split\\nNo matter the training split that currently is your best fit, you should consider changing your split to \\noffer your body some variety in the way you train it. Just as it is important to change your weight and \\nreps or rest time between sets, altering how you split up your training is another way to maintain con-\\ntinual progress in training adaptations and avoid stagnation. For beginners, starting on a whole-body \\ntraining split and then slowly progressing to splits that allow more volume to be done for each muscle \\ngroup is a necessity. See the table for a suggested succession of training splits based on training \\nexperience. Start with the split that corresponds to your level of training experience and progress to \\nthe next split as you reach a new level of training experience.\\nTraining experience (months) Optimal training split\\n1 to 3 Whole-body training split\\n4 to 9 Upper- and lower-body training split or two-day training split\\n10 to 18 Three-day training split \\n19+ Four- or five-day training split'),\n",

The two heads are \\nthe long head (or outer head) and the short head \\n(or inner head). The major difference between \\nthem is where each muscle attaches on the \\nscapula (shoulder blade). The tendon of the long \\nhead attaches farther back on the scapula than \\nthe short head. This is why they are referred to \\nas \\nlong head and short head. Both biceps heads \\nconverge into one tendon near the elbow, and \\nthis attaches to the radius to cause flexion of the \\nelbow when the muscles contract, such as when \\ncurling a dumbbell.\\nTo flex the elbow, the biceps brachii receives help \\nfrom the assistance muscle called the brachialis. \\nThis muscle lies underneath the biceps muscles \\nand starts at the humerus (upper arm bone) and \\nattaches to the ulna. The bulk of this muscle is \\nlower than the bulk of the biceps muscle, which \\nallows it to offer the most help during the first 30 \\ndegrees of elbow flexion. The brachialis is also \\nstrongly involved in elbow flexion when the hands \\nmaintain an overhand grip on the bar. The brachio-\\nradialis, although considered a forearm muscle, \\nalso helps at the initiation of elbow flexion. It is \\nstrongly involved in elbow flexion when the hand is \\nin a neutral position, such as during hammer curls.\\nWith the exception of underhand chin-ups, there \\nare no compound exercises for biceps. Even the \\nunderhand chin-up is considered a back exercise. \\nTherefore, almost all true biceps exercises are \\nsingle-joint or isolation exercises. However, the \\nexercises you choose should stress the different \\nbiceps heads as well as the brachialis, which helps \\nto make the biceps appear larger (particularly the \\nlower portion) when it is properly developed. For \\ndetailed descriptions of all biceps exercises, refer \\nto chapter 19. For basic guidelines for designing \\nbiceps workouts based on the current training split \\nused, see table 5.14. Most exercise choices for \\nthe biceps workout should be underhand (supi -\\nnated) grip curls, such as barbell curls, dumbbell \\ncurls, and preacher curls.

Though you do not need to famil-\\niarize yourself with all the different forearm muscles \\nshown in figure 5.7, you should recognize the differ-\\nence in those referred to as the wrist flexor group \\nand those referred to as the wrist extensor group. \\nThe wrist flexor group is composed of forearm mus-\\ncles that perform wrist flexion—the movement of the \\npalms toward the inner forearm, such as during a \\nwrist curl. The wrist extensors, on the other hand, \\nare involved in performing wrist extension—moving \\nthe back of the hand toward the back of the forearm, \\nsuch as when you twist the throttle on a motorcycle.\\nIt is wise to train the forearms after the biceps \\nbecause they are used so strongly during all \\nbiceps exercises. Typically, choosing one wrist \\ncurl (flexion) exercise and one reverse wrist curl \\n(extension) exercise is sufficient for working the \\nforearm muscles after biceps, especially if reverse-\\ngrip or hammer-grip curls were performed. If grip \\nstrength is a limiting factor on back and biceps \\nexercises, including a specific grip exercise may be \\nwarranted. The grip exercise should be done before \\nthe wrist curl and reverse wrist curl exercises. For \\na complete listing and detailed descriptions of all \\nforearm exercises, see chapter 20. If training with a \\nwhole-body, upper- and lower-body, or two-day split, \\nyou may consider skipping specific forearm work \\nand relying on the fact that the forearm muscles are \\nused during back and biceps exercises. For basic \\nguidelines for designing forearm workouts based \\non the current training split used, see table 5.15.\\nFIGURE 5.7 Forearm muscles: \\n(a) the flexor muscles are worked by the wrist curl, and (b) the extensor \\nmuscles are worked by the reverse wrist curl.\\nba'),\n",

The vastus lateralis, vastus \\nmedialis, vastus intermedius, and rectus femoris \\nall originate from different attachment points on \\nthe thigh and hip bone, but they all converge on one \\ncommon tendon to perform knee extension, such \\nas when you kick a ball (see figure 5.8). Because \\nthe rectus femoris originates on the hipbone, not \\nthe femur (thigh bone) as with the other three quad-\\nriceps muscles, it also is involved in hip flexion, \\nsuch as when you lift your knee up. Although all \\nfour muscles work together to straighten the knee, \\ncertain exercises are better for targeting specific \\nparts of the quad. For instance, the leg extension \\nbest targets the rectus femoris muscle. However, \\ndoing leg extensions with the toes turned in places \\nmore stress on the outer quad (vastus lateralis), \\nand doing leg extensions with the toes pointed \\nout better targets the inner quads (vastus media-\\nlis). The leg press hits all four quad muscles, but \\nresearch shows that the emphasis is on the medi-\\nalis muscle. Conversely, the hack squat tends to \\nplace more emphasis on the outer quads (vastus \\nlateralis). Squats and lunges, however, hit the \\nfour quadriceps muscles fairly evenly, along with \\nthe leg adductors, hamstrings, gluteus maximus, \\nand other muscles. For detailed descriptions of all \\nquadriceps exercises, see chapter 21.\\nFor maximizing leg size, you should start your \\nquadriceps workout with one or two squat exercises \\n(with barbells, Smith machine, or dumbbells) or leg \\npress exercises, depending on the type of split you \\nare training with. These exercises are compound \\nexercises that involve extension at the knees and \\nhips. Therefore, they use not only the quadriceps \\nmuscles but also the hamstring and gluteus max-\\nimus muscles (powerful hip extensors). Because \\nthese large muscle groups work together to perform \\nthe exercise, they provide great strength. This is \\nthe reason that these exercises should be at the \\nbeginning of your leg workout. You should train \\nthese muscles when they are at their strongest so \\nthat the greatest amount of weight can be used for \\nstimulating the most muscle growth.\\nWith the squat and leg press exercises you \\nshould routinely alter your foot position to slightly \\nchange the specific muscle fibers that are used \\nduring the exercise. Although squats hit all four \\nquadriceps muscles pretty equally, slightly greater \\nemphasis can be directed to certain muscles by'),\n",

It also is \\npossible to reduce the emphasis on the quadriceps \\nand increase the emphasis on the hamstrings and \\ngluteus maximus by moving the feet farther forward \\nfrom the hips. The farther the feet are placed in \\nfront of the hips, the greater the stress placed on \\nthe hamstrings and gluteus maximus and the less \\nstress the quadriceps receive.\\nThe leg press, on the other hand, reduces the \\namount of stress placed on the hamstrings and \\ngluteus maximus and maximizes the stress placed \\non the quadriceps; the majority of stress hits the \\nvastus medialis muscle. This is due to the seated \\nposition of the angled leg press. The seated posi-\\ntion keeps the hips flexed at about 90 degrees \\nwhen the legs are fully extended. Since the ham-\\nstrings and gluteus maximus are involved in exten-\\nsion of the hips during compound leg movements, \\ntheir involvement is minimized on the leg press. \\nIt’s optimal to include some form of lunging or \\nstepping exercises to train the legs unilaterally. \\nBecause these exercises are compound move -\\nments done one leg at a time, they require a \\nlot of stabilization from small and large muscle \\ngroups. That means they use most of the leg \\nmuscles including the quads, hamstrings, glutes, \\nand adductor and abductor muscles. Not only do \\nthese types of exercises help develop overall size \\nof the thigh muscles, but they also build functional \\nstrength, which transfers to more strength on other \\nexercises, such as squats.\\nThe only type of isolation exercise for quadriceps \\nis leg extension exercises, where the only move -\\nment that occurs is extension at the knee. This \\nfocuses a good deal of the stress on the rectus \\nfemoris muscle, although you can encourage more \\ninvolvement from the vastus lateralis or vastus \\nmedialis by altering the position of the feet, as \\ndescribed previously. You should perform leg \\nextension exercises at the end of the quadriceps \\nworkout after you perform the more demanding \\ncompound exercises.

The gluteus maximus, also referred to \\nas the \\nglutes, are the large buttock muscles. The \\nglutes are involved in extending the legs back \\n(as when standing up from a seated position) \\nand kicking the legs back behind the body. The \\nhamstrings are composed of the biceps femoris, \\nthe semitendinosus, and the semimembranosus. \\nCollectively the hamstring muscles not only flex \\nthe knee, as when you bend your knee, but they \\nalso work in conjunction with the glutes to extend \\nthe legs at the hips (see figure 5.9).\\nAlthough compound quadriceps exercises like \\nthe squat, hack squat, lunge, and step-up are tra-\\nditionally considered quadriceps exercises, they \\nalso largely involve the glutes and the hamstring \\nmuscles. For this reason, most bodybuilders per-\\nform fewer hamstring exercises than quadriceps \\nexercises.\\nEven though the hamstrings involve three dif -\\nferent muscles that work together to perform leg \\nflexion and hip extension, specific exercises better \\ntarget each muscle. The Romanian deadlift hits the \\nentire hamstring fairly evenly along with the glutes \\nbecause of the hip extension involved in this exer-\\ncise. The biceps femoris is better targeted with \\nlying and standing leg curls. The semitendinosus \\nand semimembranosus, on the other hand, are \\nbetter targeted with seated leg curls. Therefore, \\na thorough hamstring workout should include one \\nexercise that involves hip extension (such as the \\nRomanian deadlift) and knee flexion (such as the \\nleg curl). For a complete listing and detailed descrip-\\ntions of all hamstring exercises, see chapter 22. If \\nfollowing a whole-body training split, you may forfeit \\nspecific hamstring exercises since the compound \\nquadriceps exercises also use the hamstrings \\nand glutes very strongly.

Both \\nmuscles perform extension at the ankle, such as \\nwhen you stand up on your toes.\\nCertain exercises are better than others at \\ntargeting the two calf muscles. For detailed \\ndescriptions of all calf exercises, refer to chapter \\n23.

The soleus, on \\nthe other hand, is better targeted with seated calf \\nraises or any calf raise that is performed with the \\nknee bent to about 90 degrees.\\nThe best way to train calves is to include one \\nor two exercises that target the gastrocnemius \\nmuscle and one exercise that targets the soleus \\nmuscle. Most bodybuilders train their calves after \\nthighs. Some also include a second or third work-\\nout of the calves if they do not train legs twice a \\nweek. The reason for this is that the calves, partic-\\nularly the soleus, are made up of a slightly higher \\npercentage of slow-twitch muscle fibers. These \\nmuscle fibers have a high-endurance capacity and \\nrecover more quickly than fast-twitch muscle fibers. \\nThis is also the reason that many bodybuilders \\ntrain their calves with very high reps (20 to 30 reps \\nper set). However, the best way to train calves is \\nwith the use of a periodized program that cycles \\nthe number of reps performed.

This is because \\nthe abdominals are postural muscles that stay \\nflexed for long periods to support the spine. There-\\nfore, they tend to be slightly higher in slow-twitch \\nmuscle fibers than the other muscle groups. Most \\nbodybuilders train the abdominals a minimum of \\nthree times per week and some train them every \\nday. For most people, training abdominals on two \\nor three nonconsecutive days per week will suffice. \\nBecause the abdominals are often trained with no \\nmore resistance than the person’s body weight, \\nthey are frequently trained with reps in the range \\nof 15 to 30. However, even abdominal training \\nshould be periodized to cycle the rep range and \\nresistance used. Although many people fear that \\nusing heavy resistance on ab exercises will make \\nthe waist too big and blocky, it is essential to train \\nthe abdominal muscles like any other muscle \\ngroup. Increasing the development of the abdom-\\ninal muscles improves definition, when body fat is \\nlow. It also helps to increase core strength, which \\ncan cross over to help increase overall strength.\\nThe best way to train the abdominals is by \\nchoosing four exercises that each target a dif -\\nferent area of the abdominals for each workout. \\nHowever, if you train with a whole-body, upper- and \\nlower-body, or two-day training split, you won’t have \\nthe time to do four separate abdominal exercises. \\nIn this case, you should choose one or two exer -\\ncises that target one area of the abdominals and \\nrotate the abdominal region trained for every work-\\nout.

But one problem that arises \\nfrom consistency is that the muscles quickly adapt \\nto a workout when it is used for too long. To prevent \\nmuscle adaptation from turning into stagnation, you \\nneed to frequently expose your muscles to different \\ntraining techniques. Having numerous techniques \\nto draw from allows you to continually provide new \\ntraining stimuli to your muscles for optimal growth. \\nThis chapter presents training methods that are \\neffective for maximizing muscle mass.\\nThe techniques are categorized by the type of \\nacute variable of training that is being manipulated \\nin each workout. Each technique is rated on a scale \\nof 1 to 5 for four critical areas:\\n1. Time—the amount of time that a specific \\nworkout typically takes to complete. This \\nhelps you immediately determine whether \\nthis training technique will fit your training \\nschedule. The higher the number, the \\nlonger the workouts for that specific tech-\\nnique will take to complete.\\n2. Length—the amount of time required for \\nfollowing the program consistently before \\nappreciable results are noticeable. This \\nhelps you determine whether you have the \\npatience required in order for a certain pro-\\ngram to demonstrate results. The higher \\nthe number, the longer you must follow \\nthis technique in order to realize results.\\n3. Difficulty —the amount of weightlifting \\nexperience required for using the program \\neffectively. This helps you decide whether \\nyou have enough training experience to \\ntake on specific training techniques. The \\nhigher the number, the more training exper-\\nience you should have before attempting \\nthat particular technique.\\n4. Results—how effective the program seems \\nto be for mass gains in most people. This \\nhelps you estimate how much muscle \\nmass you can expect to gain with each pro-\\ngram. The higher the number, the greater \\ngains in muscle mass you can expect from \\na particular program.\\nEach training technique provides a sample work-\\nout to give you an indication of how the particular \\ntechnique can be used. Some provide details on \\nexercise selection, rep ranges, total sets, and \\ntraining frequency that you need to follow closely. \\nHowever, others offer just a snapshot for one \\nparticular workout or one workout cycle. These \\nare just templates, and you are encouraged to \\nsubstitute your own exercises where warranted \\nto maintain variety.\\nAlthough you need not use every method listed \\nin this chapter, if you have more than a year of train-\\ning experience, you should eventually try a majority \\nof the methods to determine those that work best \\nfor you. Then you can cycle these techniques, \\nalong with the basic programs covered in chapter \\n5, to create a periodized program that delivers the \\ndesired results and prevents the muscles from \\nstagnating. Chapter 7 covers periodized schedules \\nfor building muscle mass using the programs and \\ntechniques covered in chapters 5 and 6. In the \\nprograms, weights are given in pounds; please \\nsee appendix for metric conversions.'),\n",

This can be done \\nby increasing the number of exercises performed \\nthat make up one set, by limiting the number of \\nsets performed per muscle group, or by increasing \\nthe number of sets performed for an exercise in a \\ngiven time. They all are effective ways to increase \\nyour training intensity.\\nSuperset Training\\nSuperset training is a method that pairs exer -\\ncises for agonist and antagonist muscle groups, \\nsuch as biceps and triceps, and involves perform-\\ning a set for each muscle group back to back \\nwith no scheduled rest between exercises. See \\ntable 6.1 for sample exercise pairs that work \\nwell for supersets. Superset workouts typically \\nconsist of two or three exercise pairs for each \\nmuscle group. See table 6.2 for a sample triceps \\nand biceps superset workout. Superset train -\\ning offers several advantages over straight-set \\ntraining. The most obvious advantage is time. \\nBecause of the limited rest between exercises, \\nsuperset workouts are generally quicker to per -\\nform than other training methods that allow rest \\nperiods between sets and exercises. Another \\nadvantage of supersets is that you’ll actually be \\nstronger in the second exercise. Research has \\nfound that a muscle will be stronger if preceded \\nimmediately by a contraction of its antagonist, \\nor opposing muscle group. For example, when \\nyou do a superset of barbell curls and triceps \\nextensions, in that order, you’ll be stronger on the \\ntriceps extension and vice versa. This happens \\nbecause normally the muscle you’re training \\nis somewhat limited by its antagonist. When \\nbench-pressing using straight sets, for instance, \\nthe back muscles inhibit the contraction of your \\npecs to a certain extent. Doing a set of rows \\nshortly before benching, however, lessens this \\ninhibitory effect, allowing your pecs to contract \\nmore forcefully. As a result, you’ll be able to train \\nwith more weight and get stronger and bigger. \\nAnother benefit to superset training is enhanced \\nrecovery. When you alternate every set of triceps \\nwith a set of biceps, you increase blood flow to \\nthose muscles because when you’re doing curls, \\nyour triceps are still contracting, which increases \\nblood flow to them and aids in recovery. This \\nhelps your body remove waste products and \\ndamaged muscle tissue as a result of exercise. \\nKeep rest periods short between supersets (1 \\nto 2 minutes).\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 6.1 Superset Training Pairs\\nMuscle pair Exercises\\nChest and back Bench press and barbell \\nrow\\nShoulders and back Shoulder press and \\npull-up\\nBiceps and triceps Barbell curl and triceps \\npressdown\\nQuadriceps and \\nhamstrings\\nLeg extension and leg \\ncurl\\nTABLE 6.2 Supersets for Biceps and Triceps\\nExercise Sets Reps\\nBarbell curl 3 8-10\\nSuperset with triceps pressdown 3 8-10\\nPreacher curl 3 8-12\\nSuperset with lying triceps \\nextension\\n3 8-10\\nSeated dumbbell curl 3 8-12\\nSuperset with triceps bench dip 3 8-12'),\n",

As an example for shoulders, a \\nlifter would perform a set of shoulder presses and \\nimmediately follow that set with a set of lateral \\nraises with no break. That equals one compound \\nset. After the set of lateral raises is finished, the \\nlifter would rest for a couple of minutes and then \\nstart back with shoulder presses. This might \\nbe performed for two or three compound sets. \\nThe compound can then be followed with other \\nshoulder exercises that are performed either in \\nstraight sets or as another compound set. While \\nthe exercise choices are not that critical, there \\nare two strategies that are usually used with com-\\npound sets. Exercise choices can be made either \\nto target a different section of the desired muscle \\ngroup (such as the dumbbell shoulder press and \\nthe bent-over lateral raise) or to target a similar \\npart of the muscle group (such as the dumbbell \\nshoulder press and the machine shoulder press). \\nThe major benefits of compound-set training are \\nintensity and time. Training two exercises for one \\nmuscle group without any rest between exercises \\nsignificantly increases the intensity of the workout \\nand places greater demands on the muscle fibers \\nbeing trained as well as on your entire body. It also \\ndramatically reduces the amount of time required \\nto train a muscle group. This makes it a great work-\\nout technique when you want to push a particular \\nmuscle group beyond its comfort zone or when you \\nare short on time. Because compound-set training \\nis a very high-intensity technique, you should use \\nit infrequently or for short periods, because over-\\ntraining is possible if done for too long.

It uses \\nthree exercises for the same muscle group back \\nto back with no rest between sets, as opposed to \\njust two exercises. For smaller muscle groups like \\nbiceps, triceps, and deltoids, one group of tri-sets \\nperformed for two to four sets is typically enough \\nto train the muscle group effectively. When smart \\nexercise choices are selected, one tri-set can prop-\\nerly target all areas of most major muscle groups. \\nAs with compound-set training, the major benefits \\nof tri-set training are higher-intensity training and \\nless training time required. Of course, it also means \\nthat the technique should be used infrequently and \\nfor short periods to prevent overtraining.

The foundation \\nof this training method involves very low volume \\nand very high intensity. Most followers do as few \\nas one set per exercise and only one to three exer-\\ncises per muscle group (see table 6.6). Intensity \\nfor this technique is not so much about the weight \\nused but about training beyond the point of muscle \\nfailure. Every set must be taken beyond failure \\nwith the use of forced reps, negative-rep training, \\nand even partial-rep training (where as much of \\nthe range of motion of the exercise is performed \\nuntil the weight cannot be budged). The theory \\nbehind HIT is that if multiple sets of an exercise \\nare performed, every set cannot be trained with \\nmaximal intensity. By doing one and only one set \\nof an exercise, you have a better chance of training \\nwith maximal intensity.\\nVolume is also kept low with HIT to minimize \\nthe time spent in the gym. Because volume is low \\nwith HIT , it allows the lifter to follow a whole-body \\ntraining split or a two-day training split, depending \\non whether the lifter wants to train each muscle \\ngroup two or three times per week.\\nThere is no research to specifically support the \\ntheory of HIT , and anecdotal reports are varied. \\nSome lifters experience considerable gains in \\nstrength and muscle mass. But for most, the \\nprogress soon comes to a halt. The problem may \\nlie in the fact that volume is an acute variable \\nthat does not get manipulated in this program. \\nTherefore, following HIT for only four to six weeks \\nwould be a smart way to use it. After training with \\nHIT you should switch to a training program that \\nuses fairly high volume. The sample HIT program \\nin table 6.6 is a two-day split done twice a week. \\nIn this program, each set should be preceded with \\none short warm-up set before each exercise with \\napproximately 50 percent of the weight you will use \\nfor the main working set. Do only about four to six \\nreps with this lighter weight. Perform each set to \\nmuscle failure and have a spotter help you perform \\nthree or four forced reps after reaching muscle \\nfailure. Resist the negative portion of the forced \\nreps for added intensity and consider attempting \\na few partial reps at the very end of the set.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5'),\n",

It also requires that \\nyou do that in the same amount of time as for the \\nprevious workout.

The following training techniques alter the \\nreps performed in each workout. This can be done \\nby using specific rep ranges, using extremely high-\\nrep training, dividing the reps up throughout the \\nday, altering the range of motion of specific reps, \\nperforming reps with additional help after muscles \\nhave fatigued, changing the speed at which reps \\nare performed, or emphasizing a certain part of \\nthe rep. These all work to boost muscle growth \\none rep at a time.\\n5–10–20 Training\\nThis program is actually an advanced version of \\ntri-sets (see Tri-Set Training earlier in this chapter). \\nWith most tri-set programs you perform equal reps \\non all three exercises, but this one uses very spe-\\ncific repetition ranges for each exercise. The first \\nexercise in the tri-set is done for just 5 reps. This \\nis a good rep range for boosting muscle strength. \\nThe second exercise is done for 10 reps. This is \\nthe ideal rep range for building muscle mass. The \\nlast exercise in the tri-set is done for 20 reps. This \\nrep range enhances muscle endurance but also \\nfurther promotes muscle hypertrophy. Combining \\nall three of these rep ranges gives you a program \\nthat trains the muscles in every respect necessary \\nto get them big, lean, and strong.\\nExercise selection plays an important role in \\nthe 5–10–20 program because of the imposed \\nrep ranges. The first exercise should be a basic \\nexercise, preferably using a barbell. Because \\nthe reps on this exercise are so low for building \\nstrength, basic multijoint exercises with a barbell \\nare best (see table 6.8 for sample exercise choices \\nfor each exercise). The second exercise is done \\nwith a moderate number of reps for putting on \\nmuscle size; therefore, it should be another basic \\nexercise (similar to the first) but performed with \\neither dumbbells or a machine. The third exercise \\nis the high-rep set, so the best exercise choices \\nare single-joint isolation moves. These can be done \\nwith dumbbells, but cables or machines are your \\npreferred method to give your muscles continuous \\ntension throughout the entire range of motion.\\nBecause this program is so demanding on the \\nmuscles and on your entire body, you’ll need to \\nget plenty of rest for optimal recovery. Allow each \\nmuscle group trained with the 5–10–20 program at \\nleast five days of rest before training them again. \\nI suggest you plan on working each muscle group \\njust once per week, as shown in table 6.9. Remem-\\nber that you can substitute these exercises for any \\nof the appropriate ones in table 6.8. Perform one \\nset of each exercise, resting just long enough to get \\nset up on the next exercise. After the last exercise \\nis completed, rest two minutes before repeating in \\nthe same order. Repeat for a total of two to four \\ntri-sets. Follow the program for no longer than 6 \\nweeks. This is a fairly grueling regimen to maintain \\nfor any longer. But don’t think that you have to train \\nevery body part with 5–10–20. You can choose to \\ntrain just one or a few of your troublesome body \\nparts with the 5–10–20 program to bring them up \\nto par with the rest of you.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5'),\n",

Your mark for increasing \\nthe weight is when you can get 70 reps or more \\nwith a weight.\\nLet’s walk through a sample set of standing \\ndumbbell curls using the hundreds training \\napproach. Grab your appropriately weighted \\ndumbbells and perform dumbbell curls as you \\nnormally would with a heavier weight. Keep your \\nform on the dumbbell curls strict as described in \\nchapter 19 and keep your reps moderately paced \\nand under control at all times. If you chose the \\ncorrect weight, you will reach momentary muscle \\nfailure somewhere between rep 60 and rep 70. \\nHere’s where you get a rest but only for as many \\nseconds as the number of reps you have left to \\ncomplete. In other words, rest 1 second for every \\nremaining rep you have left. If you completed 65 \\nreps, then you rest 35 seconds, and then attempt \\nto do the remaining 35 reps. If you fail to com -\\nplete those final 35, use the same method—rest \\n1 second for every rep you have left until you \\nreach the 100-rep mark. Sounds simple . . . until \\nyou actually try it. This method is only for those \\nwith at least one full year of consistent strength \\ntraining experience.\\nThe benefit of hundreds training is how it \\nincorporates the muscle fibers in the muscle. \\nBecause the weight is so light and the reps \\nare so high, it thoroughly trains the slow-twitch \\nmuscle fibers in the beginning of the set. All \\nmuscles are composed of two major types \\nof muscle fibers—slow-twitch and fast-twitch \\nmuscle fibers. Slow-twitch muscle fibers tend \\nto be used for endurance-type activities—there -\\nfore, higher reps tend to train them best. Fast-\\ntwitch muscle fibers are used for more powerful \\nactivities—therefore, they are better trained \\nwith heavy weight and low reps, or with fast, \\nexplosive-type movements. Most muscles are \\nclose to 50 percent slow-twitch and 50 percent \\nfast-twitch muscle fibers. This means it’s a good'),\n",

With hundreds training you will hit \\nthe slow-twitch muscle fibers during the first 60 \\nreps or so. After that, your muscles will have to \\ncall on the fast-twitch muscle fibers to help out \\nthe fatigued slow-twitch fibers. Doing this many \\nrepetitions causes biochemical changes in the \\nmuscle, which aid in muscle growth. It also leads \\nto greater growth of blood vessels that feed the \\nmuscle fibers to enhance the delivery of blood, \\noxygen, nutrients, and hormones to the muscle \\ncells. This environment increases the growth \\npotential of the muscle fibers.\\nThe best way to use hundreds training is to \\ntrain each muscle group twice per week. There -\\nfore, following an upper- and lower-body training \\nsplit or a two-day is ideal with this style of train -\\ning. The only difference is that you can do up to \\nthree exercises for larger muscle groups (chest, \\nback, and quadriceps) because you perform only \\none set per exercise with hundreds training. Try \\nhundreds training for about two to four weeks; it \\nis very intense and will be difficult to follow for \\nany longer. Then follow it with a standard mass \\ntraining that uses heavy weight and low reps. \\nAnother way to use hundreds training is to spo -\\nradically train one muscle group or your entire \\nbody with hundreds training for just one or two \\nworkouts to change your training style and shock \\nthe muscles for added growth. See table 6.11 for \\na sample training regimen using the hundreds \\ntraining technique. Each of the workouts in this \\nprogram is to be done twice weekly.

Simply stated, this pro-\\ngram involves the completion of 100 reps per day \\non one exercise for any body part that you deem \\nis behind in growth. It is different from hundreds \\ntraining in that you don’t perform all 100 reps at \\none time, plus you do this for one muscle group \\nevery day for eight weeks. By doing so many reps \\nevery day, you enhance the endurance capacity of \\nthe muscle. Enhanced endurance is facilitated by \\nan increase in the capillary density of the muscle. \\nCapillary density refers to the number of capillar-\\nies (small blood vessels where nutrient and gas \\nexchange take place between the blood and the \\nmuscle cells) a muscle is supplied with. Muscle \\nhypertrophy tends to lower the capillary density \\nbecause of the greater amount of muscle present. \\nThis also happens with low-rep, heavy-weight \\ntraining, because this style of training forces the \\nmuscle to rely more on the energy it can derive \\nwithin the muscle cell, not from the blood. By \\ndoing the 50–50 method, you can boost the cap-\\nillary density of a muscle and therefore enhance \\nthe delivery of nutrients, anabolic hormones, and \\noxygen to the muscle. In addition, you enhance \\nthe removal of biochemical waste products from \\nthe muscle. This results in bigger muscle pumps, \\nmore rapid recovery of the muscle, and ultimately \\ngreater potential for muscle growth.\\nTo follow the 50–50 method, choose the muscle \\ngroup you want to bring up to par with the others. \\nThen choose one exercise for that muscle group. \\nThis will be the exercise you will do every day, \\neven on the days you don’t normally train that \\nmuscle group. See table 6.12 for a list of the best \\nexercises to use with the 50–50 method. You will \\nneed to perform 100 reps a day of that exercise \\nin two segments in the day. That means you will \\nperform 50 reps at a time, separated by about \\n8 to 12 hours, with a weight that challenges you \\nbut is not so heavy it causes you to fatigue by the \\n50th rep. For example, if you want to build up your \\nbiceps, you will do 50 reps of dumbbell curls in \\nthe morning—say at 9:00 a.m.—and again in the \\nevening—maybe at 9:00 p.m. The weight you use \\nis critical to your success. If it’s too heavy, then it \\nis likely to lead to overtraining. A good rule is that \\nwhen you reach the 50th rep you should feel as \\nthough you could complete about 10 more reps. \\nFollow this program for no more than eight weeks \\nto see decent results and prevent stagnation.

Its name \\ncomes from the total number of reps per set you \\nperform with this training technique. In each set, you \\ndo a total of 21 repetitions but as three separate \\nsets of 7 reps. You start the set from the start posi-\\ntion and do 7 reps through the first half of the range \\nof motion (see table 6.13). After you complete the \\nfirst 7 reps, you do another 7 reps but only through \\nthe last half of the range of motion. When those 7 \\nare complete, you finish with 7 reps through the full \\nrange of motion of that exercise. Using the barbell \\ncurl as an example, you start with your arms fully \\nextended, holding a barbell across the front of your \\nthighs. First you curl the weight up 7 times only to \\nthe point where your arms are parallel with the floor. \\nThen you curl the weight up 7 times from the point \\nwhere your arms are parallel with the floor to the \\npoint where they are close to your shoulders. After \\nthese 7 reps, you perform 7 standard barbell curls \\ngoing through the full range of motion.\\nThe 21s can be done with virtually any exercise \\nbut are most practical with single-joint isolation \\nmovements. Multijoint exercises, like the bench \\npress and squat, involve so many secondary and \\nstabilizing muscles that straight sets prove the \\nmost effective. See table 6.13 for a sample of the \\nbest exercises to use with 21s. Regardless of the \\nexercise, you’ll need to use lighter resistance than \\nusual when doing 21s, since your muscles are unac-\\ncustomed to the increased number of reps. Using \\ncables or machines for this training technique is \\nan excellent way to maintain continuous tension on \\nthe muscle. This is especially important, because \\nthe tension on the muscle is typically decreased \\nat full flexion when you use free weights.\\nWith 21s you can most effectively work on \\nflexibility within the joint during the first 7 reps, \\nsince you begin each rep with the working muscle \\nin a fully stretched position. The middle 7 reps \\nare most productive in terms of muscle growth \\nand development, because you’re stronger in the \\nsecond half of the movement and you can squeeze \\nthe contraction at the top for maximum peaking. \\nThe last 7 reps essentially serve the purpose of \\nburning out the muscles, which is great for initiat-\\ning new growth.\\nTo work 21s into your current routine, do three \\nsets of them as the first exercise for a body part \\n(after a proper warm-up, of course), then resume \\nwith straight sets for all other movements in that \\nbody-part workout. Or do one to three sets of 21s \\nas the last exercise for a particular body part to \\nburn it out. To avoid overtraining, decrease your \\nvolume for the body part you’re doing 21s with \\nby doing one fewer exercise in that workout. If on \\nchest day you normally do three or four exercises, \\ndo two or three if you’re doing three sets of 21s. \\nBeginners should start off with only one set of \\n21s—remember, this is an advanced technique. \\nYou can increase to 2 or 3 sets after a couple of \\nsessions.

After a \\nthorough warm-up, the first exercise should be \\na basic exercise (see table 6.14) and done for \\nthree sets of four reps. This rep range provides \\na stimulus for gains in strength. The second \\nexercise can be another basic exercise, prefera -\\nbly a dumbbell version, or it can be an isolation \\nexercise that minimizes the help of assistance \\nmuscle groups. Completing three sets of eight \\nreps will provide the best stimulus for muscle \\ngrowth. The third exercise should be an isolation \\nexercise, performed for three sets of 12 reps. \\nThis rep number will provide a potent stimulus \\nfor muscle growth and will encourage biochemical \\nchanges in the muscle that will enhance muscle \\ngrowth and endurance (the ability to do more \\nrepetitions with a given weight). The last exer -\\ncise should be done for three sets of 16 reps to \\nprovide a significant pump to the muscle.

After you can no longer \\ncomplete any more positive reps with a given \\nweight, you can still do several negative reps. \\nThis is because muscles are much stronger on \\nthe negative portion of an exercise. Negative-rep \\ntraining lets you take advantage of this fact and \\nthe fact that this high-intensity technique can spur \\nnew growth when done from time to time. Using \\nnegative-rep training for boosting muscle growth \\nis different from using negative-rep training to \\nimprove muscle strength. For using negative-rep \\ntraining to enhance muscle strength, see chapter \\n9. Resisting the weight down on the eccentric, or \\nnegative, portion of an exercise causes definite \\nmuscle damage. When muscle fibers are damaged, \\nit sets off a cascade of steps that leads to muscle \\ngrowth. It also develops protection from further \\neccentric overloading. That is why you want to use \\nthis technique infrequently. Once a tolerance for it \\nhas been built, the muscle damage is much less. \\nTherefore, stopping after you have used it once \\nor twice for a muscle group is the wisest way to \\nadd this technique to your training program. Then \\ntake a break from it for at least two months. You \\nwill need to do only two or three negative reps at \\nthe end of the last set for each exercise you do. \\nHave a spotter or two—depending on the amount \\nof weight you use—help you perform the positive \\nportion of each rep.

This \\nmethod requires you to slow your rep speed down to \\n10 seconds on the positive portion of the lift and an \\nadditional 10 seconds on the negative portion. You \\nshould use a weight that is about 50 to 70 percent \\nof the weight you normally lift and attempt to com-\\nplete 5 to 10 reps per set. Because of the intense \\nnature of slow contractions, you need to perform \\nonly about two or three exercises per muscle group \\nand only two sets per exercise. You should also \\nallow five to seven days of rest for all major muscle \\ngroups trained with superslow training. Try this work-\\nout method for four to six weeks before changing to \\na different routine that involves normal-speed reps. \\nAnother way to incorporate superslow training into \\nyour lifting program is to do it every other workout \\nfor each muscle group or throw in one superslow rep \\nset each workout for any muscle group—do it either \\nat the beginning or at the end of the workout. There \\nare many benefits to superslow training that make \\nit an effective technique for adding muscle mass. It \\nminimizes the momentum of the weight to maximize \\nthe force placed on the muscle being trained. It \\nhelps you to develop the connection between mind \\nand muscle, because the slow movement forces \\nyou to concentrate on the muscle contraction.

The \\nslow reps build strength by keeping muscles under \\ntension for a longer period. The longer they have \\nto support the weight, the more damaged they get, \\nand hence the more muscle they will develop. And \\nending each set with the normal reps increases \\nmuscular endurance. See table 6.16 for the Speed-\\nSet Training program.\\nEach set has 15 reps. Reps 1 to 5 are the \\nexplosive reps, executed superfast. Reps 6 to 10 \\nare excruciatingly slow, taking five seconds on the \\npositive and another five seconds on the negative. \\nAnd reps 11 to 15 are done at your normal pace \\n(or roughly 1 to 2 seconds up and the same back \\ndown). Because of the intensity of this regimen, \\nyou’ll pick a weight at which you could normally do \\n20 to 25 reps.\\nAvoid unilateral (single-arm or -leg) exercises. \\nDoing 15 reps (five of them ultraslow) per set \\ntakes a long time, and if you’re doing something \\nlike dumbbell rows or presses on each side, it \\ncould put too much strain on your stabilizer and \\ncore muscle groups. To spare your core muscles, \\nI recommend incorporating machines, particularly \\nthe Smith machine, which also allows you to exert \\nmaximum explosive power on the fast reps.\\nThis regimen is ideal for training opposing \\nmuscle groups in each workout, pairing chest with \\nback, biceps with triceps, shoulders with calves, \\nand legs with abs. That way, you ensure that each \\nmuscle group gets the full benefit of training. \\nBecause the rep level is high and the technique \\nis so intense, you could very easily burn out, say, \\nyour triceps while training your chest, making it \\nimpossible for your triceps to benefit from this \\ntype of training on the same day.\\nStart by doing two sets per exercise during \\nweeks 1 and 2 and build up to three sets per exer-\\ncise during weeks 3 and 4.

You \\nwill lift this weight for a total of four minutes, taking \\nshort rest breaks each time you reach muscle \\nfailure. The goal is to see how many reps you can \\ncomplete in these four minutes and to progressively \\nincrease the total number of reps you can complete \\nover several weeks. You should be able to complete \\nat least 40 reps in four minutes the first week you \\nuse this technique. The goal is to complete 60 reps \\nin four minutes after four to six weeks.\\nThe week before taking this journey, use all the \\nexercises as listed and find the weight on each \\nexercise that allows you to complete a minimum \\nof 15 reps and a maximum of 19 reps. The weight \\nyou select is critical to your success. A weight that \\nallows you to do fewer than 15 reps will be too \\nheavy to ever get you close to the 60-rep goal in \\nfour to six weeks. A weight that allows you to get \\nmore than 19 reps will be too easy and will enable \\nyou to reach the goal of 60 reps in less than four \\nweeks. Do only enough sets per exercise to deter-\\nmine the proper weight to use and then move on \\nto the next exercise. Do all the exercises in each \\nworkout in the order listed.\\nThere are two main ways that you can go about \\ntraining with the Four-Minute Muscle program. The \\nfirst way is to go to failure and then rest as little as \\npossible before picking up the weight and going to \\nfailure again and continuing in this fashion until the \\nfour minutes are up. The problem with this strategy \\nis that there is no way to advance the number of \\ntotal reps you can complete other than hoping that \\nyou will increase muscle endurance each time you \\ntrain this way, which should allow you to complete \\nmore reps in that four-minute window.\\nA smarter strategy is to pace yourself by sticking \\nwith a set amount of rest time between sets. The \\nfirst time you do this workout, rest 20 seconds \\nbetween sets each time you hit failure. Do this \\nagain in week 2. Then in week 3, drop your rest \\nto 15 seconds between sets each time you hit \\nmuscle failure. Do this again in week 4. If you do \\nnot hit the goal of 60 reps in week 4, drop to 10 \\nseconds of rest between sets in weeks 5 and 6, \\nand you should hit your goal of 60 reps or at least \\nvery close to 60 reps.\\nIf you don’t hit the 60-rep mark by the end of \\nthe six weeks on all exercises, don’t worry about \\nit. Hitting the 60-rep goal is not critical to the \\nresults you will have. The results you can you \\nexpect in four to six weeks on this program are \\nbigger muscle size, less body fat, and an increase \\nin muscle endurance. Muscle endurance means \\nthat you will be able to complete more reps with \\na given weight. For example, if you can complete \\n10 reps with 70-pound dumbbells on the dumbbell \\nbench press, you can expect to be getting a solid \\n12 to 15 reps with that same weight. It also means \\nyou’ll be able to use heavier dumbbells (say 75- or \\n80-pounders) to get those same 10 reps.\\nThe reason this program delivers all of this is \\nmanifold. For starters, because you are doing an \\nexercise for four minutes with minimal rest between \\nsets, you will be burning many more calories than \\nwhen you do normal sets with two to three minutes \\nof rest between sets. This will also mean you will \\nstill be burning more calories when the workout is \\nover. All of that leads to some serious fat burning. \\nTraining this way will also place your muscles under \\na lot of metabolic stress. That means you’ll be \\ncreating waste products in your muscles, such as \\nlactate. The metabolic waste products will instigate \\na higher release of anabolic hormones like growth \\nhormone, testosterone, and insulin-like growth \\nfactor-I (IGF-I), which will stimulate muscle growth. \\nPlus dealing with these waste products will train \\nyour body to better handle and dispose of them. \\nThat will increase your muscle endurance, which \\nwill result in strength increases. Going for four \\nminutes with minimal rest like this will also place \\na lot of mechanical stress on the muscles (muscle \\ndamage). That will lead to further gains in muscle \\nsize. And training this way is so unique compared \\nto how you have previously trained that it will simply \\nshock your muscles into responding by growing \\nbigger and stronger. That’s the principle known as \\nmuscle confusion. See table 6.17, Four-Minute \\nMuscle Mayhem, for the full workout.\\nTry this program for four to six weeks. Rest about \\ntwo to three minutes between exercises.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nFour-Minute Muscle'),\n",

The following \\nprograms do just that—they manipulate the load, \\nor resistance. This can be done by altering sets \\nof heavy weight and light weight within a single \\nworkout or on each exercise during a workout. \\nSome of these techniques alter the weight during \\na set.

The theory is that the heavy \\nsets will stimulate the fast-twitch muscle fibers \\nbetter while the lighter sets promote capillarization \\nof the muscles and induce fatigue. This is often \\ndone with just one exercise, as shown in table \\n6.18. More experienced bodybuilders will some -\\ntimes do two exercises but with fewer total sets on \\neach exercise. With this method, the first exercise \\n(which is typically a basic or multijoint movement) \\nis done with heavy weight and low reps, while the \\nsecond exercise (which is often an isolation-type \\nexercise) is done with very light weight and high \\nreps (see table 6.19).

The term \\npyramid refers to a stepwise \\nincrease and decrease in weight used with each \\nset of an exercise. The triangle method starts off \\nwith three or four ascending sets. The first two \\nor three are warm-up sets that are not taken to \\nfailure. The third or fourth set usually consists of \\na weight that allows for only four to six reps. After \\nthat set the weight is progressively lowered and the \\nreps increase for another two or three sets. See \\ntable 6.20 for a sample workout using the triangle \\nmethod. The benefit of the triangle method is that \\nit allows you to slowly prepare the targeted muscle \\nfor very heavy weight. This helps to prevent injury. \\nIn addition, this method of training allows for varied \\nrep ranges, which provide different stimuli to the \\ntrained muscles.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 6.20 Triangle Chest Using Incline \\nBench Press\\nSet\\nWeight\\n(pounds) Reps Rest\\n1 135 10 2 min\\n2 185  8 3 min\\n3 225  6 3 min\\n4 245  4 3 min\\n5 185  7 3 min\\n6 165  8 –\\nTriangle Method\\nRack Pyramid Method\\nThis pyramid method is named after the dumbbell \\nrack because it is best used with preset dumb -\\nbells found in most gyms. As with the triangle \\nmethod, you start with a very light weight for 10 \\nreps to warm up. Then you gradually increase \\nthe weights of each set by the smallest increase \\navailable (usually five pounds each dumbbell) \\nuntil you can perform only one repetition. After \\nthat, if you’re really up for punishing your muscles, \\nreverse the order and decline in weight by the \\nsmallest decrease possible until you reach your \\nstarting point. Rest between sets should be kept \\nto a minimum—about one to two minutes. The \\nbenefits of the rack pyramid method are similar \\nto those of the triangle method in that it allows a \\nproper warm-up for preparing the muscle for the \\nintense training task ahead. It also provides a \\nvery broad range of reps for a variety of training \\nstimuli to the muscle. It also gives the muscle an \\nintense workout that is sure to kick-start muscle \\ngrowth. Because this method is rather grueling \\non the targeted muscles, it’s wise to use the rack \\npyramid method infrequently. It is best thrown into \\na workout to stimulate a lagging muscle group to \\ngrow. One beneficial way to use the rack pyramid \\nmethod is to use it for one exercise per muscle \\ngroup. The best exercises to use this method with \\nare the basic dumbbell mass builders and isolation \\nexercises. See table 6.21 for optimal exercises \\nto use with the rack pyramid method.

One example is that used by pro-\\nfessional bodybuilder Dean Tornabane. You begin \\nwith a weight you can perform 6 to 10 reps with \\non your exercise of choice. Perform two more sets, \\nin which you decrease the weight each set just \\nenough to allow you to perform the same number of \\nreps as you did on the first set. After the third set, \\nyou will do two more sets, increasing the weight by \\nthe same increments by which you decreased the \\nweights previously. Because of the fatigue involved, \\nthe last two sets will likely be in the low repetition \\nrange of two to four. This is supposed to work \\nsynergistically with the higher-rep sets performed \\nin the earlier sets to enhance muscle growth. See \\ntable 6.23 for a sample inverted pyramid program. \\nThis system can be performed with any exercise \\nfor most muscle groups, but it is best performed \\nfirst in the workout with a basic exercise such as \\nthe bench press, shoulder press, squat, barbell \\ncurl, or triceps extension.

The bene-\\nfit of the Oxford method is that it allows the heaviest \\nweight to be used on the first working set before \\nthe muscles are fatigued by previous working sets \\nwith lighter weight. With this descending pyramid \\ntechnique, the first set is done with 100 percent \\nof the 10RM to failure. Of course, this should be \\npreceded by one or two light warm-up sets. On the \\nsecond and third sets the weight is reduced just \\nenough to allow you to complete 10 reps to failure. \\nThe Oxford seems to work well for gaining muscle \\nmass because each set is done to muscle failure. \\nMuscle failure is important for inducing muscle \\ngrowth. The reason is that reaching muscle failure \\nstimulates the release of growth hormone (GH) \\nand insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I).

Set 2 is performed \\nusing 15 to 20 percent less weight than with set \\n1.

The last set, set 3, is performed with \\nabout 50 percent less weight than the first set, \\nsuch that 25 to 30 reps are performed for train -\\ning the slow-twitch muscle fibers.

For example, if you can do 10 reps of \\nbarbell curls with 100 pounds on the bar, you would \\nfirst complete 10 reps and then put the bar down \\nto quickly strip off about 20-30 percent (or about \\n20-30 pounds). You immediately perform as many \\nreps as possible with that weight before putting it \\ndown and stripping another 20-30 percent off the \\nbar and doing more reps. This can continue as \\nmany times as you like, although most bodybuild-\\ners do one or three drops per drop set. Regardless \\nof how many drops are done per drop set, it is \\ncounted as only one set. Most bodybuilders per -\\nform about two or three drop sets per exercise. \\nChoose two exercises per muscle group, usually \\none compound exercise and one isolation exercise, \\nand do three drop sets for each. Another way to \\nuse drop-set training is to do the last set of every \\nexercise as a drop set. \\nThe benefit of drop-set training is similar to that \\nof forced-rep training in that it lets you push your \\nmuscles beyond their limits. Forcing the muscles \\nto continue contracting with lighter weight will \\ncause an elevated response of growth hormone \\nand IGF-I. The trick is to keep the rest between \\ndrops to a minimum. It’s a good idea to have a \\nspotter help you strip the weight or use dumbbells \\nfor the quickest drops in weight.

This changes the biochemical adaptations \\nthe muscles undergo by altering the type of fuel \\n(ATP , creatine phosphate, or glycogen) they rely \\non during sets and to recover with between sets. \\nThe chemicals produced from the use of different \\nfuels can stimulate certain biochemical pathways \\ninvolved in the process of muscle growth. The fol-\\nlowing programs change the rest periods between \\nsets in an effort to stimulate muscle growth. This \\ncan be done by decreasing the rest between sets \\nfrom workout to workout or by limiting the amount \\nof rest between sets.\\nRest Rundown\\nThis is a program where rest time between sets is \\nreduced by about 15 seconds every consecutive \\nworkout. The program starts with three-minute \\nrest periods between sets and progressively \\ndrops to about 15 seconds over a 12-week \\nperiod. The goal is to use the same weight for \\nthe same amount of reps each week. While that \\ndoesn’t seem like progress when looking at the \\nresistance used and the repetitions completed, \\nit is remarkable progress when considering the \\ndrastic reductions in rest time. This trains the \\nbiochemical pathways in the muscle to allow the \\nmuscle to recover faster and allows for more reps \\nto be performed with a given weight. The ability \\nto do the same number of reps with the same \\nweight with less rest time between sets translates \\nto greater muscle growth. In fact, as discussed \\nin chapter 5, research shows that participants \\nfollowing an eight-week strength-training program \\nthat decreased the rest period between sets by 15 \\nseconds every week had greater gains in muscle \\nmass than those keeping rest periods steady at \\ntwo minutes (Souza-Junior et al. 2011). Stay at \\na rest range if you cannot complete reps in the \\nunder-two-minute range. See table 6.27 for a \\nsample weekly progression of the rest rundown \\nprogram for an athlete who trains each body part \\nonce per week. Bodybuilders often use the rest \\nrundown method to prepare for competition.

As \\nyou work one side of the body, the opposite side is \\nresting. You cycle back and forth from one side to \\nthe other. To do this, choose a weight that allows you \\nto complete about 6 to 8 reps. We will use one-arm \\ndumbbell curls as an example. Do 3 reps of curls on \\nthe right arm and immediately switch to the left arm \\nand do 3 reps of curls on the left arm. Then switch \\nto the right arm for 3 more reps of curls. Continue \\nin this fashion resting for 3 reps, then resting for \\n2 reps, and finally resting for 1 rep. In the end you \\ncomplete 14 reps per set with a weight you normally \\ncould do for only 6 to 8 reps. You basically double \\nthe amount of reps you can do with a given weight. \\nThat pushes not only muscle growth but muscle \\nstrength as well. And because you are using one limb \\nat a time, you are stronger than you are when you \\nuse two arms. That is, when you perform single-arm \\nexercises, like a one-arm dumbbell curl, you can curl \\nmore weight than half of what you could curl on a \\nbarbell using both arms, which leads to even greater \\ngains in muscle strength.\\nOn the last set of each exercise, do as many \\nreps as you can on the final rest that is supposed \\nto be just one rep. Not only will this increase the \\nintensity on the last set, but it will also serve as \\na barometer for the appropriateness of the weight \\nyou selected. If you can do more than one rep \\non the final rest of the final set of an exercise, \\nincrease the weight by 5 to 10 pounds the next \\nworkout. If you can complete only one rep on the \\nfinal rest of the final set, then the weight you \\nselected is perfect. If you can’t complete the final \\nrep on the final set, then during the next workout \\nreduce the weight by 5 to 10 pounds. If you can’t \\ncomplete the final rep on any of the first two sets, \\nthen reduce the weight by 5 to 10 pounds on the \\nnext set.\\nFollow the Alternating Rest-Pause program in \\ntable 6.28 for four weeks and then switch to a \\nnew training program.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nAlternating Rest-Pause Program\\n> continued\\nTABLE 6.28 Alternating Rest-Pause Program\\nMONDAY: CHEST, TRICEPS, ABS\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nChest One-arm dumbbell \\nbench press*\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nSmith machine one-arm \\nincline bench press\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nOne-arm low pulley \\ncable crossover\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nOne-arm cable \\ncrossover\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nTriceps One-arm triceps \\npressdown\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nOne-arm lying triceps \\nextension\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nOne-arm dumbbell \\noverhead extension\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nAbs*\\n* Do your normal ab workout here.\\nTUESDAY: LEGS\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nLegs One-leg press 3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nSmith machine reverse \\nlunge\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nDumbbell step-up 3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nOne-leg extension 3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nOne-leg curl 3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nCalves One-leg calf raise 3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nOne-leg seated calf \\nraise\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1'),\n",

Typical \\ncircuit training involves the use of machines and very \\nlight weight. What they both have in common is that \\nthe goal is to move from one exercise to the next with \\nno scheduled rest between exercises. Instead of doing \\nseveral sets for an exercise, you would do only one set \\nof an exercise before moving to a new exercise. In the \\nend, you will complete several sets of each exercise \\nafter running through the circuit several times.\\nPower circuits are designed to increase strength \\nand muscle size while helping decrease body fat. \\nThe continuous movement of circuit training keeps \\nyour metabolism high through the whole workout. \\nResearch studies show that keeping rest periods \\nunder 30 seconds burns the most calories regardless \\nof how much weight is used and how many reps are \\nperformed. Research also suggests that fat use by \\nthe body after exercise is increased more with power \\ncircuits than with a traditional weightlifting program. \\nWith power circuits the lifter does about 30 total reps \\nfor each body part with a weight that is about 75 to 85 \\npercent of the one-rep max (or a weight that could be \\nlifted for 8 to 10 reps). With power circuits it is wise to \\nuse either a training partner who can watch the clock \\nor a watch to monitor exercise time. Each exercise \\nin the circuit is performed for 15 seconds. The goal \\nis to complete as many reps as possible in those \\n15 seconds before moving on to the next exercise \\nwithout resting. When a total of 30 reps have been \\ncompleted for an exercise, the exercise is eliminated \\nfrom the circuit and a 15-second rest period is set in \\nits place on the following circuit rounds. For example, \\nif you complete 17 reps on the first pass through the \\ncircuit and 13 the second time through, on your third \\ntrip through the circuit, instead of doing more calf \\nraises, you would stop and rest for that 15 seconds \\nbefore moving on to the next exercise.\\nThe order of exercises in the circuit will affect \\nthe level of muscle fatigue that is reached during \\nthe power circuit. It is wise to alternate upper- and \\nlower-body exercises to allow the muscles to recover \\nand delay fatigue when doing power circuits, such \\nas in table 6.30. Whenever possible, push and \\npull exercises should be alternated as well. For \\ninstance, if the power circuit starts with a pulling \\nexercise such as pull-downs and then moves to a \\nlower-body exercise such as the leg press for the \\nquads, the next upper-body exercise should then be \\na pushing exercise such as the bench press, and \\nthe next lower-body exercise could be a leg curl for \\nthe hamstrings. Ideally, the power circuit should be \\ncompleted in less than 25 minutes. Full-body power \\ncircuits can be done twice a week as long as at least \\ntwo days of rest are allowed between workouts.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nPower Circuit Training\\nTABLE 6.30 Circuit Breaker\\nCIRCUIT I CIRCUIT II CIRCUIT III CIRCUIT IV\\nExercise\\nTime \\n(seconds) Reps*\\nTime \\n(seconds) Reps*\\nTime \\n(seconds) Reps*\\nTime \\n(seconds) Reps*\\nBent-over row 15  8 15  8 15  8 15 6\\nLeg press 15  8 15  8 15  8 15 6\\nBench press 15  8 15  8 15  8 15 6\\nLeg curl 15 10 15  8 15  6 15 6\\nBarbell curl 15 10 15 10 15 10 15 0\\nStanding calf raise 15 15 15 15 15  0 15 0\\nStanding military press 15  8 15  8 15  8 15 6\\nBack extension 15 10 15  8 15  6 15 6\\nLying triceps extension 15 10 15 10 15 10 15 0\\nRest 2 min Rest 2 min Rest 2 min\\n*Reps listed are a suggested goal; do as many as you can in 15 seconds, and do as many passes through the circuit as it takes to reach \\n30 reps total in each exercise.\\nNote: For all weighted exercises, use a weight equal to 75 percent to 85 percent of the 1RM (or a weight that normally can be lifted for 8 to 10 \\nreps on that exercise).

With \\nso many exercises to choose from for each muscle \\ngroup, it only makes sense that one way to design a \\ntraining program is through manipulation of exercise \\nchoices. This can be done by changing the order \\nof compound and isolation exercises for a given \\nmuscle group, making minute changes in the way \\nexercises are performed (changes in grip or spac-\\ning of feet), limiting the workout to a specific type \\nof equipment, or performing exercises that train \\nonly one side of the body. All such methods can \\nbe effective means of increasing your muscle size.\\nPreexhaust Training\\nThis training method involves performing an isolation \\nexercise before a multijoint exercise for that same \\nmuscle group. The point is to fatigue the muscle \\nbeing trained with the isolation exercise so that it \\nbecomes the weak link in the multijoint exercise. For \\ninstance, an isolated muscle group such as the del-\\ntoids is fatigued (or preexhausted) with a single-joint \\nexercise, such as the dumbbell lateral raise, before \\ntraining it with a heavier, compound movement such \\nas the dumbbell shoulder press. The reason for this \\nis that the compound exercise involves the targeted \\nmuscle as well as at least one assistance muscle. \\nDuring the shoulder press, the deltoids are assisted \\nby the triceps. While this helps to lift more weight \\non the compound exercise, it can limit the muscle \\nfatigue the targeted muscle receives. This is espe-\\ncially true if the assistance muscle is much weaker \\nthan the targeted muscle. If this is true, then often \\nthe exercise ends when the assistance muscle, not \\nthe targeted muscle, has fatigued.\\nPreexhaust works to fatigue the primary muscle \\ngroup via the isolation exercise so that it can be \\nfurther fatigued on the compound exercise that \\nfollows. Of course, the strength of the targeted \\nmuscle will be compromised on the second exer-\\ncise. This prevents most bodybuilders from using \\nthe preexhaust method regularly, yet some use it \\nspecifically to limit the amount of weight they can \\nuse on the compound exercise. If a bodybuilder \\nhas an injury that is aggravated by a specific \\ncompound move, preexhaust training will limit the \\namount of weight he or she can use on the set \\nand thus limit the overall stress placed on the \\ninjured muscle or joint. Preexhaust can be followed \\nfor four to six weeks or done for each body part \\nonce every four to six workouts. See table 6.31 \\nfor good exercise choices to pair up for preexhaust \\ntraining. For a routine, do three sets of 10 to 15 \\nreps on the first exercise and three sets of 6 to \\n10 reps on the second. Or to use this system as \\na compound set, do one set of 10 to 15 reps on \\nthe first exercise and immediately follow with one \\nset of 6 to 10 reps on the second one. Rest about \\ntwo to three minutes and repeat this process twice. \\nRegardless of which method you choose, follow the \\npreexhaust pairs with one other exercise for that \\nmuscle group done in straight-set fashion.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 6.31 Sample Preexhaust Exercise \\nPairs\\nMuscle \\ngroup\\nIsolation \\nexercise Multijoint exercise\\nChest Pec deck Bench press\\nIncline fly Incline bench press \\nCable \\ncrossover \\nDecline bench press \\nShoulders Dumbbell \\nlateral raise\\nDumbbell shoulder \\npress\\nFront raise Barbell shoulder press \\nBack Straight-arm \\npulldown\\nPull-down, pull-up, \\nbarbell row\\nTriceps Triceps \\npressdown\\nTriceps dip\\nOverhead \\nextension \\nClose-grip bench press\\nBiceps Preacher curl Close-grip chin-up\\nLegs Leg extension Leg press\\nLeg curl Squat'),\n",

The variations of that exercise are \\nordered from hardest to easiest. An example of this \\ncan be explained using the dumbbell bench press. \\nThe hardest version of the dumbbell bench press is \\non an incline bench set between 30 and 45 degrees. \\nDoing a dumbbell bench press on a flat bench is \\neasier than doing an incline dumbbell bench press \\nbut harder than doing a decline dumbbell bench \\npress. Thus, an example of extended-set training \\nusing the dumbbell bench press would be to do \\none set of incline dumbbell bench press followed \\nimmediately by one set of dumbbell bench press on \\na flat bench using the same amount of weight and \\nfinishing with one set of decline dumbbell bench \\npress with the same weight. Because the rest time \\nis minimal between each bench adjustment, these \\nthree exercises can be considered one extended set.\\nEach adjustment with extended-set training \\nplaces the body in a position that is stronger than \\nthe previous position. This makes the weight easier \\nto lift on each successive position change, allowing \\nyou to continue doing more reps, when normally \\nyou would have failed if your body position had not \\nchanged. Not only does this allow you to train with \\nmore intensity, but the change in body position also \\nincreases the number of muscle fibers targeted in \\neach specific muscle group.\\nTo follow extended-set training, first choose a \\nweight that normally limits you to four or five reps on \\nthe first exercise (even though you will attempt no \\nmore than four reps). For each change in exercise \\nmovement for that extended set, you will attempt \\ntwo to four reps. Do not do more than four reps on \\nany exercise except on the final movement of the \\nextended set. You can work to failure on the last \\nexercise of all extended sets. If you have three or \\nfour exercise changes per extended set, you will have \\na total of about 7 to 16 reps. So in essence, you are \\nusing a weight on each movement that is best for \\nstrength gains, but at the end of the extended set \\nthe total reps that the muscle group has performed \\nfall in the range that is optimal for muscle growth.\\nThe first exercise movement should be the exer-\\ncise that your body is weakest at compared to all \\nother exercises in the extended set. Each succes-\\nsive exercise movement in the extended set should \\nbe one that your body is stronger at compared to \\nthe previous exercise yet weaker than the one \\nthat follows. Rest time between sets will always \\nbe minimal but can be varied depending on the \\nbiomechanical advantage gained in the proceeding \\nset. Some exercises will be dramatically easier than \\nthe previous one; for these, rest should involve \\nchanging only your body position. Some exercises \\nprovide a minimal biomechanical advantage; for \\nthese you may rest up to 15 seconds before per-\\nforming. Rest between extended sets for three to \\nfour minutes. Perform between one and three sets \\nfor each extended set, depending on the number of \\nexercise movements used in the extended set and \\nthe number of years training experience you have.\\nThis is an extremely advanced training technique \\nbecause it involves heavy weight with very little \\nrest. These two training techniques are usually at \\nopposition to one another, meaning you either train \\nheavy or fast, but rarely ever both—until now.\\nFor most bodybuilders, doing one extended set \\nwill suffice. This will depend on the amount of exer-\\ncise movements you include in each extended set \\nas well as your training experience. Some extended \\nsets involve as few as two different movements \\n(such as with shrugs), while some include as many \\nas nine (such as with the ultimate biceps extended \\nset). See examples of extended sets in table 6.32. \\nThe more exercise movements per extended set, \\nthe fewer total extended sets you will need. Most \\nlifters will need about two or three extended sets for \\nthe trap workout, while many will struggle to finish \\none ultimate biceps extended set.\\nYou can incorporate extended sets into your train-\\ning in a number of ways. You can do one extended \\nset per muscle group along with other straight sets \\nfor that muscle group. You can do one giant extended \\nset per muscle group. Or you can choose two differ-\\nent extended sets for each muscle group—as long \\nas they complement each other and do not mimic \\nexercise movements. Follow extended-set training \\nfor about 4 to 6 weeks, and follow it with a training \\nprogram that incorporates standard sets and higher \\nreps such as the finish pump method or triangle \\ntraining method. Do not return to extended-set train-\\ning for at least 12 weeks. There are several reasons \\nfor this. The first is the intensity factor, as described \\npreviously. The other problem is exercise order. With \\nthis style of training, many of the basic movements \\nare trained toward the end of the extended set. This \\nis the reverse order of a typical bodybuilding workout.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nExtended-Set Training'),\n",

It uses multiple variations of a single exer-\\ncise to ensure that all muscle fibers in a muscle \\nare adequately trained.\\nTo understand the concept of exercise angles, \\nyou need to know the basic structure of muscle. \\nOne important but surprising fact is that individ -\\nual muscle fibers rarely run the entire length of \\nthe muscle. Muscles are actually composed of a \\nsequence of one- to four-inch (two-and-a-half- to \\nten-centimeter) segments of muscle fiber linked \\ntogether. For that reason, you can’t think of muscle \\nfibers as being synonymous with the actual muscle. \\nThis is critical, as the growth of each muscle fiber \\ndepends on whether it is actually stimulated during \\na particular exercise. In many cases, muscle fibers \\nremain unused and just go along for the ride during a \\nlifting movement. Whether the fiber is used depends \\nnot only on the amount of resistance but also on \\nthe angle of the exercise and the specific range of \\nmotion used in the exercise. If the angle (such as \\nin the flat bench press versus incline bench press) \\nand the range of motion (such as partial movements \\nversus full range of motion) do not call a specific \\nmuscle fiber into action, no growth will occur in \\nthat fiber. To make sure you hit each muscle fiber \\nand stimulate it to grow, you have to use a variety \\nof exercises. And even for a given exercise, you \\nmust use variety. For example, on dumbbell bench \\npresses, you can adjust the angle of the bench from'),\n",

This is known as \\nunilateral training. Most training programs neglect \\nunilateral training; at best, some include a one-\\narm or one-leg exercise here or there, such as \\nthe concentration curl or one-leg leg press. This \\ncan lead to imbalances in muscle strength and \\ndevelopment.\\nResearch shows that you can produce more \\nforce on each side of the body when you perform \\nunilateral exercises than you could produce \\nduring bilateral exercises, such as the barbell \\nbench press. In addition, because there are \\ncrossover effects from training a muscle on one \\nside of the body, one-sided training can encour -\\nage better muscle growth on the untrained side. \\nThat is, the resting side also receives nervous \\nstimulation from the increased blood flow that is \\ncaused by exercising the muscles on the other \\nside of the body. This enhances the delivery of \\noxygen, nutrients, and hormones to the resting \\nmuscles while helping to flush away waste prod-\\nucts from the previous workouts. The result may \\nbe better muscle regeneration and growth of the \\nmuscles.\\nAnother benefit of one-sided training is that \\nit trains the core muscles (the visible and deep \\nmuscles of the abdomen and low back) that are \\nimportant for a better overall strength base. \\nPerhaps the best point about one-sided training, \\nhowever, is the pure novelty of the stimulus that \\nit places on the body. It stimulates the nervous \\nsystem and muscle fibers in a more unique way \\nthan any other training programs. New stimuli \\nmay lead to gains in muscle mass and muscle \\nstrength.\\nOne-sided training breaks up workouts into right-\\nside and left-side training days. In other words, \\nmuscles on the left side of the body (such as \\nbiceps and triceps) are trained on one day, and \\nthe same muscles on the right side of the body \\nare trained on a different day. The program (shown \\nin table 6.35) consists of four workouts per week \\nthat train the entire body once. Workout 1 consists \\nof the right chest, shoulder, traps, triceps, back, \\nand biceps. Workout 2 consists of the left chest, \\nshoulder, traps, triceps, back, and biceps. On work-\\nout 3 you would hit the right quad, hams, glutes, \\nand calves. Workout 4 closes out the body with the \\nleft quad, hams, glutes, and calves. Abs can be \\ntrained at the end of the first and fourth workout.\\nThe volume of work performed per muscle group \\nis fairly low (two exercises per muscle group for \\ntwo or three sets per exercise) because this type \\nof training is somewhat shocking on the nervous \\nsystem. The weight used should be light enough \\nto allow for 10 to 12 reps per set. Follow the one-\\nsided training for only two to four weeks before \\nswitching back to normal bilateral training, and do \\nnot revisit this alternative training style more than \\nonce every four to six months.\\nIn addition to the exercises given in the sample \\nworkouts, there are many other unilateral exercises \\nyou can perform for each muscle group.

Doing \\nthese exercises twice allows you to milk that exer-\\ncise for all the benefits it offers. And those benefits \\ninclude increased size, strength, and fat loss.\\nBy doing these exercises at the beginning and \\nend of the workout, you maximize muscle growth \\nand strength. That’s because you do the exercise \\nfirst when you are freshest and strongest, which \\nmaximizes your strength and the mechanical over-\\nload you place on the muscles. When you do the \\nexercise at the start of the workout you will use \\nheavy weights and lower reps (6-8 per set). This rep \\nrange is best for building strength and mass due \\nto the heavier load it places on the muscles, which \\nmaximizes muscle damage, and therefore strength \\ngains and growth. When you damage muscle fibers, \\nthey are replaced with new ones that grow bigger \\nand stronger in an effort to adapt to the overload \\nplaced on them. But that’s just one way that muscles \\ngrow. Using this rep range also better stimulates the \\nproduction of the anabolic hormone testosterone.\\nWhen you work that same exercise at the very end \\nof the workout, you are preexhausted by the exer-\\ncises that preceded it. This maximizes the fatigue \\nthat you place on the muscles, as does the rep range \\nyou will use at these points. You’ll do three sets at \\nthe end of the workout. Set 1 uses the same weight \\nthat you started with. This is to further enhance the \\nmuscle damage you started at the beginning of the \\nworkout by forcing the muscles to move that weight \\nwhen they are already fatigued. You’ll be able to \\nget only a few reps because of this, but every one \\nof these reps will push muscle damage that much \\nfurther. You finish with two sets of 12 to 15 reps. \\nThis higher rep range will take your muscles to the \\nlimits of fatigue, not to mention the fact that you \\nkeep the rest between sets in these three final \\nsets to one minute to really fatigue the muscles. \\nFatigue is also critical for muscle growth due to the \\nbiochemical waste products in the muscle cells from \\nthe burning of glucose and fat for the energy needed \\nfor the muscles to contract. This signals an increase \\nin anabolic hormones and growth factors like growth \\nhormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-\\nI). The anabolic factors, along with testosterone, \\ninfluence muscle growth by enhancing the growth of \\nthe new muscle fibers that will replace the damaged \\nones and by enhancing muscle protein synthesis. \\nMuscle protein synthesis works to build up all of the \\nmuscle fibers by providing them with more protein. \\nSince muscle fibers are made of protein, more pro-\\ntein means bigger muscle fibers.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 6.37 Bookend Workouts\\nWORKOUT 1: CHEST, BICEPS, ABS\\nMuscle group Exercise Sets/reps Rest\\nChest Bench press 3/6-8 2-3 min\\nIncline dumbbell bench press 3/8-10 2 min\\nIncline dumbbell fly 3/10-12 1-2 min\\nCable crossover 2/12-15 1-2 min\\nBench press 1/to failure\\n1\\n2/12-15\\n1 min\\n1 min\\nBiceps Barbell curl 3/6-8 2-3 min\\nIncline dumbbell curl 3/8-10 2 min\\nCable concentration curl 3/10-12 1 min\\nBarbell curl 1/to failure\\n1\\n2/12-15\\n1 min\\n1 min\\nAbs Hanging leg raise\\n2 2/6-8 1-2 min\\nCrunch 3/to failure 1 min\\nHanging leg raise 1/to failure\\n2/to failure1,3\\n1 min\\n1 min'),\n",

Having been used by competitive \\nbodybuilders and other high-performance athletes, \\nthe concept involves categorizing all weight-train-\\ning exercises down to one of two types—pushing \\nmovements and pulling movements—and split -\\nting up workouts accordingly. A typical push day \\nincludes exercises for the chest, shoulders, quads, \\nand triceps because these are considered the \\npushing muscles. And a typical pull day trains the \\nback, biceps, hamstrings, and traps. But weight \\ntraining is not quite that simple.\\nFor most muscle groups, you can do at least \\na few exercises that don’t fall under the strict \\ndefinition of either a push exercise or a pull exer-\\ncise. For example, leg extension, leg curl, biceps \\ncurl, triceps extension, lateral raise, and fly are \\nall exercises that are technically neither pushing \\nnor pulling movements. They are actually what we \\nwould consider \\nangular movements. That is, the \\nmovement doesn’t follow a straight line but rather \\nthe path of an arc. These are always isolation exer-\\ncises because they involve only a single joint. Push-\\ning or pulling a weight in a straight line involves \\nmultiple joints working together. Thus, push and \\npull exercises are always multijoint exercises.\\nThe push–pull training split works well for power-\\nlifters and strength athletes who rarely do angular \\n(isolation) exercises. But because bodybuilding \\nrelies heavily on such movements, I created the \\npush–pull training split into the push–pull–angle \\nsplit. In it, you’ll have one push day in which you \\nhit chest, legs, shoulders, triceps, and calves with \\nmultijoint exercises; one pull day in which you \\nhit back, traps, and biceps, again with multijoint \\nmoves, as well as abs; and two angle days, which \\ncollectively hit all major muscle groups with isola-\\ntion exercises only.\\nOne angle day trains the chest, legs, shoulders, \\nand triceps, while the other trains back, biceps, \\nforearms, and abs. You’ll end up training each \\nmuscle group twice per week, once with compound \\nmoves (push or pull) and again with isolation \\nmoves (angle). This way, you can focus on one \\nheavy basic training day for each muscle group \\nwhere you use lower reps, and one lighter isolation \\nday where you use higher reps, for a multifaceted \\napproach to overall growth, muscle mass, and \\nstrength. Not only is each muscle being trained \\nmore frequently, but each is getting different types \\nof stress (heavy and light) each week. Separating \\nthe types of exercises into two workouts for each \\nbody part will be a welcome change for your mus-\\ncles, resulting in greater hypertrophy and strength \\ngains.\\nFollow the four-day push–pull–angle training split \\nas suggested in table 6.38 for four weeks. Feel \\nfree to use it longer, but after four weeks on this \\nsample program be sure to make some changes, \\nsuch as swapping out the exercises listed in table \\n6.39 in the Push–Pull–Angle Exercises box for \\nothers listed as follows. Also, feel free to alter \\nrep ranges and rest periods, depending on your \\ntraining goals. The routine listed in table 6.38 is \\na combination of strength and hypertrophy, using \\nlow- (4-7), moderate- (8-12), and high-rep schemes \\n(15-20).\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nPush–Pull–Angle Training'),\n",

That \\nincrease in resistance necessitates the application \\nof more force toward the top of the lift, which limits \\nthe slowing at the top of an exercise that normally \\noccurs to stop the weight.\\nBands are also great to travel with because they \\nweigh little yet provide ample resistance.

This time period allows the pro -\\ncesses of muscle recovery to kick in so that the \\nmuscle damage inflicted in the previous workout \\ncan be repaired and the depleted fuel stores \\ncan be replenished. However, on occasion, going \\nagainst conventional thinking on recovery can be \\nan advantage for making muscle gains. This can \\nbe done by training similar muscle groups on con-\\nsecutive days or even training them twice in one \\nday. Increasing the frequency of training for short \\nperiods can lead to more frequent muscle growth.\\nBack-to-Back Training\\nBack-to-back training refers to training a muscle \\ngroup on two consecutive days. It is also referred \\nto in some bodybuilding circles as feeder work -\\nouts, because the concept is to train the muscle \\ngroup again the very next day but with very \\nlight weight, higher reps, fewer sets, and very \\nlow intensity to help increase blood flow to the \\nmuscle tissue. The theory is that this will supply \\nthe recovering muscle cells with more nutrients \\nsuch as amino acids and glucose (both critical for \\nmuscle growth and strength), anabolic hormones \\nsuch as GH and testosterone, and more oxygen \\nfor faster recovery. It will also help remove the \\nwaste products and cellular debris that were cre-\\nated from the previous workout. It also leads to \\ngreater water flow from the blood supply into the \\nmuscle—this is the cause of the pump—which \\nis believed to turn on muscle-building pathways \\nbecause of the stretch that is placed on the \\nmuscle cell by the volume overload. While no \\nstudies have looked at this effect on muscle \\ngrowth directly, one study found that the cortisol \\nresponse on the second workout day is signifi -\\ncantly lower and the testosterone levels are \\nslightly higher (Pullinen et al. 2002). Hormonal \\nresponses to a resistance exercise performed \\nunder the influence of delayed-onset muscle \\nsoreness. This means that a greater anabolic \\nenvironment is created within the muscles, which \\ncan enhance the potential for muscle growth and \\nstrength gains.\\nThe first back-to-back workout for each muscle \\ngroup should be very intense. Muscle failure \\nshould be reached on all sets and followed with \\nforced reps or drop sets. Volume should also be \\nhigh (12 to 16 sets per muscle group) to ensure \\nthe muscle is thoroughly fatigued. The second \\nworkout should be lower in both intensity and \\nvolume. Perform only about six to eight sets per \\nmuscle group and perform 15 to 20 reps, never \\nreaching muscle failure. See table 6.42 for a \\nsample back-to-back workout program.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 6.42 Back-to-Back Back Attack\\nWorkouts 1 and 2 are performed on two consecutive \\ndays.\\nExercise Sets Reps\\nWORKOUT 1\\nPull-up 3 6-10*\\nBarbell row 4 6-10**\\nSeated cable row 4 6-10**\\nPulldown (underhand grip) 4 6-10**\\nWORKOUT 2\\nPulldown (wide grip) 2 15-20\\nBarbell row 2 15-20\\nSeated cable row 1 15-20\\nPulldown (underhand grip) 1 15-20\\n*Perform two or three forced reps at the end of each set.\\n**Perform each set to failure.

The program is based on research \\nthat shows that when muscles are trained twice \\nin the same day, the amount of muscle glycogen \\nincreases by nearly double the normal value. Since \\nglycogen pulls water into muscle cells, the muscle \\ncells become fuller (more pumped). This causes \\na stretch on the muscle cells that is believed to \\ntrigger muscle growth.\\nTwice-a-day training also encourages capillary \\ngrowth in muscle tissue and increases the density \\nof fuel-metabolizing mitochondria in the muscle \\ncells, both of which help the muscle to assimilate \\nnutrients. It also works to boost resting metabolism \\nafter the twice-a-day workouts, which can help to \\nencourage fat loss during cutting phases of training.\\nWith twice-a-day training the same exercises \\nshould be done for both workouts. This is because \\ndifferent exercises stress different muscle fibers, \\nand it is essential to stress the same muscle \\nfibers in the second workout as were stressed in \\nthe first. However, the order of these exercises is \\nnot critical. So some bodybuilders begin the first \\nworkout with compound movement and then finish \\nwith isolation exercises. In the second workout \\nthey reverse that order. This helps to prevent \\nboredom. Repetitions for both workouts should \\nbe high (in the range of 12 to 20) to prevent over-\\nstressing the targeted muscle group and better \\ndeplete muscle glycogen. Rest should be no more \\nthan 60 seconds between sets to best deplete \\nglycogen stores, increase caloric expenditure, and \\nfacilitate fat loss.\\nWorkouts should be separated by at least three \\nbut no more than eight hours of rest. If there is not \\nenough time between sessions, the testosterone \\nresponse that occurs from training may be blunted, \\nand cortisol levels may increase too much. Muscles \\nshould receive about three to seven days of recov-\\nery before you train them again.

Whether you’re a beginner, \\nintermediate, or advanced weightlifter and just \\nwant to add general muscle mass to your frame, or \\nyou want to shed body fat while adding muscle, or \\nyou have specific muscle groups you want to focus \\non building up, this chapter has a program for you.\\nMASS-BUILDING PROGRAMS\\nAlthough it is well established that certain exercise \\nchoices, orders of exercises, volumes, resistances, \\nand amounts of rest between sets are better than \\nothers for developing muscle mass, sticking within \\nthose guidelines for too long can actually hinder \\nyour progress. This is the foundation of periodiza-\\ntion (covered in chapter 3). For instance, although \\nthe repetition maximum continuum indicates that \\nusing a range of 6 to 12 reps per set is best for \\nmuscle hypertrophy, sticking within those confines \\nwill lead to stagnation in muscle growth. There -\\nfore, while some of your training should be done \\nwith this rep range, you also need to work in both \\nlower- and higher-rep ranges. The question, then, \\nis how and when to do this. This rationale also \\napplies to the other acute variables of training. To \\nensure that gains in muscle mass are optimized \\nand persistent, smart bodybuilders realize that the \\nfrequent cycling of their workouts is as essential \\nto their progress as the acute variables.\\nDeveloping a basic cycle that carries your training \\nover the next 6 months or year is much like an insur-\\nance policy that protects your progress. This template \\nwill serve as a basic guide to steer you through your \\njourney to gain more muscle. If you are a beginner, \\nyou should follow this program as prescribed for \\nyour first 6 months of serious training. The interme-\\ndiate (6 to 12 months of training experience) and \\nadvanced (over a year of consistent training exper-\\nience) weightlifters are provided a yearlong training \\nguide. However, at this level you can take a few side \\nroads here or there as long as you mind the overall \\nscheme of the program. In the end, remember that \\neverything works, but nothing works forever.\\nBeginner Program (First Six Months)\\nThis six-month program breaks down into six four-\\nweek segments (see table 7.1). In the first three \\nsegments, you follow a whole-body training split \\nand train with weights three days per week, working \\nyour entire body each time. The first four weeks \\nyou will train one exercise per muscle group. The \\nexercises are the same for each workout and the \\nreps are 15 per set with two- to three-minute rest \\nperiods between sets. This helps to train the ner-\\nvous system during this introductory phase. The \\nsecond four-week cycle adds a second exercise to \\neach muscle group to increase both volume and \\nvariety in the way the muscles are trained. Exer -\\ncises performed are the same for each workout and \\nreps are 12 to 15 per set with two- to three-minute \\nrest periods. The third four-week cycle changes \\nthe exercises at each different workout for the \\nweek. This provides three different exercises per \\nmuscle group at the end of the week in an effort to \\ntarget all the muscle fibers in each muscle group.'),\n",

The exercises per muscle group drop \\nback to just one per workout but increase in number \\nof sets. Reps drop down to 10 to 12, while rest \\nperiods remain the same at two to three minutes \\nbetween sets.\\nIn the last three segments, you’ll train with a \\ntwo-day training split for a total of four workouts per \\nweek. During the first four weeks exercises will be \\nthe same for each muscle group on the two work-\\nouts that are done each week. Most major muscle \\ngroups will be trained with three exercises for a \\ntotal of six sets per muscle group. The exceptions \\nare legs, which will be trained with four exercises, \\nand the smaller muscle groups like biceps and \\ntriceps are trained with only two exercises per work-\\nout. During the second four-week cycle, exercises \\ndrop back to about two per major muscle group, \\nbut the sets increase to three per exercise. Rest \\nperiod during this entire phase drops down to one \\nto two minutes between sets. Each muscle group \\nis trained with different exercises on the different \\nworkout days. During the last four-week cycle the \\nexercises increase to about three for most major \\nmuscle groups, as do the sets for most (three per \\nexercise). After this phase is completed, you can \\ngraduate to the intermediate program.\\nIntermediate Program  \\n(Six Months to One Year)\\nIf you are an intermediate lifter, you are at a \\nunique level of weightlifting experience. Because \\nof neurological training, you have surpassed the \\nrapid gains in strength that beginners experience, \\nyet you haven’t started to plateau in the gains \\nrelated to muscle fiber growth. You also have \\na fair amount of knowledge of and enthusiasm \\nfor strength training. This is the stage where the \\nparticular training program is not as critical for \\nmaking continued gains as long as you maintain \\na periodized plan.\\nIf you are an intermediate lifter, you should \\nfollow a basic training program that involves a \\nthree-day or four-day split, as discussed in chapter \\n5. Making frequent changes in exercise selection \\nprovides the muscles with resistance from a vari-\\nety of angles to stress different individual muscle \\nfibers within the targeted muscle. However, the \\nmost critical change comes in the form of the \\nresistance, or weight, used and the number of reps \\nperformed per set.\\nThe yearlong program found in table 7.2 outlines \\nthe rep ranges you should follow throughout the \\nyear to graduate to advanced weightlifter status. \\nBecause research shows that periodized programs \\nthat last a minimum of 8 weeks and a maximum \\nof 20 weeks are the most beneficial (Rhea and \\nAlderman 2004), the intermediate program follows \\na 20-week linear mass cycle, then an 8-week mass \\nmicrocycle, and finally a 20-week undulating-mass \\ncycle (which assumes you are using a four-day \\nsplit). Each phase of the program allows one week \\nof active recovery (where other physical activity out-\\nside of weightlifting is encouraged) before moving \\nto the next phase, along with one week of active \\nrest during the undulating phase, for a 52-week \\nprogram that will keep the muscle gains coming. \\nBut feel free to skip these active rest weeks if you \\nprefer to march straight through.\\nTABLE 7.2 Advancing Intermediate Program\\nPHASE 1: LINEAR MASS\\nWeek Rep range \\n1-4 4-6\\n5-8 6-8\\n9-12 8-10\\n13-16 10-12\\n17-20 12-15\\n21 Active rest\\nPHASE 2: MICROMASS\\nWeek Rep range \\n22 8-10\\n23 5-8\\n24 3-5\\n25 12-15\\n26 3-5\\n27 5-8\\n28 8-10\\n29 10-12\\n30 Active rest'),\n",

For example, try slow-rep training \\nduring weeks 5 to 8, negative training during week \\n23, and barbell blasting during week 26; throw in \\nsuperset and forced-rep training where desired \\nduring weeks 31 to 51.\\nAdvanced Program  \\n(More Than One Year)\\nIf you are an advanced weightlifter, you are at \\nthe most difficult level of weightlifting in which to \\nencourage muscle growth. This is because you \\nhave spent a long time training and therefore are \\ncloser to reaching your genetic ceiling for muscle \\ngrowth. Because of this, you must frequently train \\nwith advanced training techniques that are high \\nin intensity to help stimulate muscle growth. The \\none-year advanced program in table 7.3 cycles \\nadvanced training techniques found in chapter 6 \\nwith basic training splits to offer periods of lower \\nintensity in which the muscles can recover before \\nthe next advanced technique starts. Feel free to \\nreplace any technique with one that better suits \\nyour needs at the time. The same can be said \\nabout the training splits. Neither the specific \\ntechniques nor the specific splits are critical to \\nthis yearlong program. What is important is that \\nyou cycle four to six weeks of advanced technique \\ntraining with about four to six weeks of a basic \\ntraining program that is lower in intensity.\\nIf you are an intermediate and are interested \\nin making gains in general mass, you should \\nfollow the basic design guidelines in chapter 5 for \\nmaking exercise selections. Rest periods should \\nbe about two to three minutes between exercises, \\nbut you should manipulate these on occasion. For \\nexample, when reps are in a low phase (4 to 6), \\nallow up to four minutes of rest between sets. \\nWhen reps are in a high phase (more than 12), \\nlimit rest to one minute between sets. For all other \\nrep ranges, keep the rest period between sets to \\ntwo to three minutes. Cycling the rest periods will \\nfurther enhance gains in muscle mass.\\nIf you are concerned with gaining muscle while \\nlosing body fat, you should limit rest periods to one \\nminute or less. Research suggests that keeping \\nthe rest periods below one minute can enhance \\nthe number of calories burned during and after a \\nstrength training workout, regardless of the rep \\nrange used (Falvo et al. 2005). It is also wise to \\nuse as many compound exercises as possible. \\nThese use more muscle groups than isolation exer-\\ncises and therefore help to burn more calories.

Maybe they want to maximize \\nboth mass and strength, maybe they want to get \\nlean and large, or maybe they want to develop a \\nspecific muscle group. If you are an intermediate or \\nadvanced weightlifter and are interested in specific \\ngoals, you should follow a long-term program that \\nmanipulates the appropriate training variables to \\nenable you to reach those goals. This portion of \\nthe chapter has detailed program cycles to match \\ncommon goals shared by most bodybuilders. More \\nthan likely, any goal regarding strength training \\nfor muscle mass will be listed here. Try one of \\nthe following programs that meets your goals, or \\ndesign your own personalized program based on \\nthe knowledge you have acquired through reading \\nthis book.\\nLean and Large\\nChances are that if you are interested in bodybuild-\\ning or strength training for muscle mass, you are \\nalso interested in building just lean muscle mass \\nand not adding body fat. Body fat blurs the shape \\nand striations of well-developed muscles.\\nAlthough a proper diet and plenty of aerobic \\nexercise are tools to help you shed body fat while \\ngaining muscle, certain strength training programs \\nare better than others for getting lean. This Lean \\nand Large program is composed of three four-week \\nphases that all emphasize compound movements \\n(see table 7.4). Compound exercises use the most \\nmuscle fibers and therefore burn the most calories.'),\n",

Training heavy in addition \\nto doing high reps has the greatest effect on \\ncalorie burn. That’s why this program uses heavy \\nweight for half the sets and light weight for the \\nfinal sets of most exercises. Rest between sets \\nis also critical for burning calories; shorter rest \\nperiods lead to greater calorie burn. This program \\nuses rest periods of 30 to 60 seconds between \\nsets and a four-day training split. However, you \\nwill be training six days a week to maximize your \\ncaloric expenditure. This means you can repeat \\nthe four-day split (done on consecutive days), with \\none rest day between workout 4 and workout 1, a \\ntotal of six times. For example, you will start with \\nworkout 1 on Monday, workout 2 on Tuesday, work-\\nout 3 on Wednesday, and workout 4 on Thursday. \\nYou rest on Friday and then continue the cycle with \\nworkout 1 on Saturday.\\nIn phase 1, you train with 6 reps on the heavy \\nsets and 12 reps on the light sets. You do two \\nheavy sets and two light sets for most exercises. \\nRest periods during this first phase are 60 seconds \\nbetween sets.\\nIn phase 2, the reps on the heavy sets drop \\nto 5 per set while reps on the light sets increase \\nto 15 per set. Lighter sets also increase to three \\nper exercise to increase volume and total calories \\nburned during the workout. Rest periods should \\ndrop to 30 seconds between sets to further \\nenhance calorie burn during and after the workout.\\nIn phase 3, the reps on the heavy sets drop \\nagain to 4 per set, and reps on the light sets \\nincrease to 20 per set. In this phase, heavy sets \\nincrease to three. Rest periods should remain at \\n30 seconds between sets.\\nAt the end of phase 3 you can continue the \\n12-week program if you feel you have more body \\nfat to lose. Take one week off from the gym with an \\nactive rest period, in which you do other activities \\na minimum of six days per week. Then simply start \\nthe program over at phase 1.\\nBig and Strong\\nFor some weightlifters getting big is not the only \\ngoal. They are concerned with developing strength \\nand muscle mass at the same time—and with \\ngood reason. Generally, as muscles increase in \\nstrength, they also increase in size. While there \\nisn’t a definite correlation between muscle strength \\nand muscle size, it makes sense that if you can \\nlift more weight or perform more reps with a given \\namount of weight, you will better stimulate muscle \\ngrowth. This follows the principle of overload.\\nThe six-month Big and Strong program cycles \\ntwo pyramid techniques—the DeLorme ascending \\npyramid method (covered in chapter 9) and the \\nOxford descending pyramid method (covered in \\nchapter 6). (See table 7.5.) With the DeLorme \\nascending pyramid technique your first set is done \\nwith about 50 percent of your 10-rep max (10RM) \\nfor a given exercise, but for just 10 reps. On the \\nsecond set, you increase the weight to about 75 \\npercent of your 10RM for that exercise and again \\nstop at 10 reps. On the third set you increase \\nthe weight to 100 percent of your 10RM for that \\nexercise and complete as many reps as you can \\nuntil reaching failure. The repetition maximum is \\nnot critical, because many powerlifters use this \\npyramid method with 3RM, 4RM, 5RM, and 6RM \\nto train for strength. In fact, during the second \\nhalf of this program you will use a 6RM during \\nthe DeLorme portion of the training. With the \\nOxford descending pyramid technique, the first \\nset is done with 100 percent of your 10RM to \\nfailure. On the second and third sets you reduce \\nthe weight just enough to allow you to complete \\nabout 10 reps. Again, the repetition maximum you \\nuse is not critical because it is commonly used \\nwith 6RM, 8RM, 12RM, and 15RM. In the second \\nhalf of this program the reps increase to 12 per \\nset. See table 7.5.\\nThe DeLorme method tends to be better for \\nderiving strength gains, while the Oxford method \\nis better for stimulating muscle growth (Fish et al. \\n2003). This may be due to the amount of times you \\nreach failure on each exercise. With the DeLorme \\ntechnique, failure is reached only once, whereas \\nthe Oxford technique elicits failure on all three sets. \\nAustralian researchers have shown that training to \\nfailure on just one set increases strength gains \\nbetter than going to failure on more than one set \\n(Drinkwater et al. 2005). Muscle failure, however, \\nseems to be important for inducing muscle growth. \\nThe reason for this is that reaching muscle failure \\nbetter stimulates the release of growth hormone \\n(GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Both \\nare anabolic hormones that stimulate muscles to \\ngrow. That is why this program cycles both meth-\\nods. In the end, you achieve greater strength and \\nmuscle growth.'),\n",

The difference in \\nthese two phases is the amount of weight you do \\non the last set of each exercise. During weeks 1 \\nto 6 you end with a weight you can do for 10 reps. \\nDuring weeks 13 to 18 you end with a weight that \\nyou can do for 6 reps. During these parts of the \\nprogram you will train each muscle group twice per \\nweek. That’s because you will need less recovery \\ntime between workouts because you do fewer total \\nworking sets per workout and train to failure on \\nonly one set per exercise.\\nYou can use the strength you gain during weeks \\n1 to 6 and 13 to 18 for lifting heavier weights \\nduring weeks 7 to 12 and 19 to 24. Weeks 7 to \\n12 and 9 to 24 take you down the pyramid as you \\ndecrease the weight on each successive set for \\nall exercises. During these phases, you train each \\nmuscle group just once per week because they \\nwill need the recovery since you will do more total \\nworking sets per muscle group, plus you will train \\nto failure on every set.\\nShortcut to Size  \\n(Micromuscle) Program\\nOne of my most popular training programs is the \\n12-week Shortcut to Size (a.k.a. Micromuscle) \\nthat is featured on bodybuilding.com and detailed \\nin table 7.6. More than a million people have \\ncompleted the program, and many have gained as \\nmuch as 20 pounds (about 9 kilograms) of lean \\nmuscle. The strength gains with this program are \\nalso phenomenal.\\nThe Shortcut to Size program is based on linear \\nperiodization using microcycles, as covered in \\nchapter 3. In week 1 your rep range will be 12 to \\n15. In week 2 you bump up all the weights and \\ndrop reps to 9 to 11. Week 3 adds weight again \\nto each exercise to drop the rep range to 6 to 8. \\nAnd in week 4 you bump the weight up again to \\ndrop reps to 3 to 5 per set. Those are the four \\nmicrocycles that you will repeat. On week 4 you \\nhave completed the first phase. On week 5 you \\ndrop the weight back down and start all over at \\n12 to 15 reps per set. This is the start of phase \\n2. But now you will be able to do each rep range \\nwith at least 5 and up to 20 pounds (a little less \\nthan 2.5 and as much as about 9 kilograms) more \\nthan you could in phase 1. In week 6 (week 2 of \\nphase 2), you will be back at 9 to 11 reps per set. \\nIn week 7, or week 3 of phase 2, weight will go up \\nagain to drop your reps down to 6 to 8 per set. \\nAnd in week 8 (or week 4 of phase 2), weight will \\nincrease for 3 to 5 reps per set. That completes \\nphase 2. And in week 9 you start the final phase \\n(phase 3) by dropping back down to 12 to 15 reps \\nper set and run through the four microcycles again \\nuntil you are back down at 3 to 5 reps per set. Of \\ncourse, in each phase you will be using 5 to 20 \\npounds more than you did in phase 2 and 10 to 40 \\npounds (4.5 to 18 kilograms) more than you used \\nin phase 1. This is how you get stronger—much \\nstronger—over this 12-week program.\\nThe constant increase in weight each week and \\nthe recycling of these four phases lead to impres-\\nsive gains in strength. The microcycles also lead to \\nmuscle hypertrophy due to the constant changing \\nof the rep ranges each week. Another reason for \\nthe gains in strength and mass has to do with the \\nfact that you keep the weight steady on each exer-\\ncise for all sets and you are forced to complete \\nthe minimum number of reps in that rep range.\\nGreater gains in strength and muscle mass are \\nguaranteed with this program. I have seen some \\nimpressive results with this program. In men, I \\nhave seen gains of strength over 90 pounds on the \\nsquat and over 50 pounds on the bench press. And \\nfor muscle, many guys have gained over 20 pounds \\nof muscle, as I mentioned. Yes, pure muscle, while \\nactually dropping body fat. Speaking of body fat, \\nwhen maximizing body fat with my training and diet \\ntweaks, some men have lost over 20 pounds of \\nbody fat. And women have also seen impressive \\ngains in strength and muscle while losing body \\nfat. Women following my program have increased \\ntheir squat strength by over 60 pounds and bench \\npress strength by 30 pounds. And they have seen \\ngains in muscle of over 10 pounds and fat loss \\nover 10 pounds.\\nThe first exercise you do for each muscle group \\n(except for abs and calves) will remain constant \\nthroughout all 12 weeks. This is the exercise where \\nyou focus on increasing your strength. Most of the \\nassistance exercises that follow the first exercise \\nwill change in every phase. For abs, the exercises \\nwill change each week based on the rep ranges. \\nThis is because some ab exercises are easier to \\ndo for higher reps, while some are difficult to do for \\nlower reps. So I organized the best ab exercises \\nfor the prescribed rep ranges.'),\n",

Yet, if you want to focus \\nmore on one of these three goals, you can also \\ndo that and still get the other benefits.\\nRest a good 3 minutes or even longer between \\nsets. The key is performing as many reps as pos-\\nsible within that prescribed rep range. More reps \\nequal more work performed each workout, and that \\nequates to greater strength gains over time. During \\nweeks 1 and 2 of each phase of the program, you \\nwill do one rest-pause set on the last set of each \\nexercise. To do this, reach muscle failure on the \\nlast set, then rack the weight and rest 15 seconds. \\nThen continue the set until you reach muscle fail-\\nure again. During weeks 3 and 4 of all phases you \\nwill do a drop set on the last set of each exercise. \\nTo do this, take the last set to muscle failure and \\nthen immediately reduce the weight by 20-30%, \\nand continue the set until failure again.\\nSuperman Training\\nThis workout program uses supersets that pair \\nopposing muscle actions. This is a bit different \\nfrom just pairing opposing (antagonist) muscles \\nbecause the exercise pairs are ones where the \\nmovements are the exact opposites. For example, \\nyou will pair the bench press for chest with the \\nbarbell row for lats. However, when you perform \\nthe lat pulldown for lats, you do not pair it with a \\nchest exercises. Rather, you pair shoulder press for \\nthe deltoids with pulldown since these exercises \\nbetter oppose each other’s movement pattern.\\nThe first benefit of supersets done this way is \\ngreater strength and power. Research shows that \\na muscle will contract with more strength and \\npower if preceded by contractions of its antagonist, \\nor opposing muscle group. For example, when \\nyou do a superset of barbell rows followed by \\nthe bench press, you’ll be stronger on the bench \\npress. In fact, Baker and Newton (2005) reported \\nthat when trained athletes performed rows before \\ndoing the bench press throw, they had significantly \\nmore power on the bench press throw than when \\nthey did it without first doing the rows. University \\nof Wisconsin at Parkside (Kenosha) researchers \\n(Ebben et al. 2011) found that when subjects did \\na six-second isometric leg curl to fatigue the ham-\\nstrings before doing the vertical jump, quadriceps \\nforce production increased by almost 15 percent \\ncompared to when they did the vertical jump with-\\nout first doing the leg curl. This phenomenon may \\nbe due to greater inhibition of the antagonist mus-\\ncles. Normally, the muscle you’re working is some-\\nwhat limited by its antagonist muscle, much like a \\nbrake on a car would limit how fast you can go if you \\nkept it depressed. For example, during the bench \\npress, the strength of the pecs is somewhat limited \\nby the contraction of the back muscles. Doing a \\nset of rows before benching, however, lessens this \\ninhibitory effect, allowing the pecs to contract with \\nmore force. Robbins et al. (2010) reported that \\nwhen participants did three supersets of rows and \\nbench presses using their four-rep max on each \\nexercise, they were able to perform more reps on \\nsets 2 and 3 than when they did traditional sets. \\nThis may also be due to the greater inhibition of \\nthe antagonist muscles, but it is also likely due to \\ngetting a longer rest for each muscle group. When \\nyou are training the opposing muscle group, the \\nother muscle group is getting some rest. And when \\nyou combine the rest taken between supersets, \\nthat equates to greater total rest for each muscle \\ngroup. For example, if you do three straight sets of \\nthe bench press with one minute of rest between \\nsets, you get one minute of rest between each \\nset of the bench press. If you do supersets of the \\nbarbell row and the bench press and rested one \\nminute between supersets, then you not only get \\nthe one minute of rest between sets of the bench \\npress, but you also get the time it took to do rows \\nas additional rest time between bench press sets. \\nIn some cases that could double the amount of \\nrest time between sets for each muscle group. \\nRegardless of the reason, being able to complete \\nmore reps with a given weight will lead to greater \\nmuscle strength and growth over time.\\nA second benefit to antagonist superset train -\\ning is that you will burn more body fat. One study \\nfrom Syracuse University (Kelleher et al. 2010) \\nfound that when participants performed super -\\nsets for chest and back, biceps and triceps, and \\nquads and hamstrings, they burned 35 percent \\nmore calories during the workout and 35 percent \\nmore calories after the workout than when they \\ndid straight sets. The big news here is the greater \\ncalorie burn after the workout is over. After all, a \\nworkout may only last one to two hours, so you \\ncan only burn so many extra calories in that time. \\nBut burning 35 percent more calories after the \\nworkout is over when you are sitting around the \\nrest of the day is where that extra calorie and fat'),\n",

This is the same main \\nreason why high-intensity interval training (or HIIT) \\noutperforms regular steady-state cardio to help \\nyou drop fat so much quicker. Superset training \\nallows you to burn more calories and fat the rest \\nof the day, which can make a serious dent on your \\nbody fat stores.\\nA third benefit of doing supersets in this fash -\\nion is that you work muscle groups that you’ve \\nlikely neglected. When was the last time that you \\nfocused on your tibialis anterior muscle, or your \\nlower traps? Probably never! This not only helps \\nyou bring up these often-weaker muscle groups, \\nbut it also helps restore balance. Not just bal -\\nanced muscle development, but it helps to remove \\nstrength imbalances that can hold your strength \\nback and predispose you to injury.\\nA fourth benefit of this style of superset training \\nis time management. You will be able to complete \\nfar more sets of exercises in less time. You will \\ncomplete about 40 to 50 total sets of exercises \\nin each workout. Yes, you read that right: 40 to \\n50 total sets! That would normally take well over \\ntwo hours, maybe even close to three hours, to \\ncomplete so much work doing straight sets. Yet \\nwith the Superman training program it will take you \\nonly about 60 to 90 minutes. This will really ramp \\nup the fat burning, not to mention muscle growth.\\nA fifth benefit of this type of training is change. \\nOne of my main mottos is \\nchange is good. Change \\nis critical in making continued progress to get \\nbigger and stronger. That’s why I offer so many \\ntraining programs. So you can keep changing up \\nyour training and keep growing bigger, stronger, \\nleaner, and better. Changing up your training in \\nthis manner is just what your body needs to finally \\nbreak through those plateaus that you’ve been \\nstuck in. When was the last time you did supersets \\nfor every muscle group for every workout? Not to \\nmention when was the last time you did super -\\nsets where every exercise was an exact opposing \\nmotion of the other? Probably never! But I’m not \\njust talking about the change this type of superset \\nprovides. There is also the change in your training \\nsplit. With this program you will work the \\nentire \\nbody in just two days. Then there’s the change in \\nyour training frequency. If you’ve been following \\nmy Shortcut to Size (Micromuscle) program, then \\nyou’ve been training each muscle group just once \\nper week (except for abs and calves). And most \\npeople train each muscle group just once per week \\nin other programs. In the Superman program you \\nwill train each muscle group twice each week. The \\nhigher frequency will help to stimulate new muscle \\ngrowth and strength gains, not to mention greater \\nfat loss.\\nOn top of all the change previously mentioned \\nwill be the change in the rep ranges each week of \\nthis five-week program. The Superman program \\nin table 7.7 uses an pendulum periodization \\nscheme. Weeks 1 to 3 will be done in a linear \\nperiodized scheme where each week the weight \\ngets heavier and the reps get fewer. You will start \\nwith 12 to 15 reps per set on most exercises in \\nweek 1. Then you will move up in weight to limit \\nyou to 8 to 10 reps per set in week 2. And then \\nyou bump up the weight again in week 3 to limit \\nyour muscles to completing just 4 to 6 reps per \\nset. And week 3 is also the starting point for the \\nnext phase of the program because now you will \\nreverse this rep pattern to follow a reverse linear \\nperiodization scheme. You already did 4 to 6 reps \\nper set in week 3, so week 4 jumps back up to 8 \\nto 10 reps per set. And then in week 5 you jump \\nback up to where you started with 12 to 15 reps \\nper set. But you will find that you are suddenly \\nmuch stronger in these rep ranges during weeks \\n4 and 5 as compared to weeks 1 and 2.

The pump is the rapid expan-\\nsion in the size of muscles during a workout. The \\npump simply refers to the filling up of muscle cells \\nwith water. When you work out, you produce waste \\nproducts in the muscle cells. These waste products \\nare the result of burning glucose and fat to fuel \\nmuscle contractions, and their build-up inside muscle \\ncells draws water (from the blood in the capillaries \\nthat feed the muscle and the area surrounding the \\ncells) into the muscle cells. As with a balloon, the \\nmore water that the muscle cell can hold, the bigger \\nthe pump. The pump essentially places a stretch on \\nthe muscle cell. This stretch not only makes muscles \\nmomentarily bigger, but it also initiates biochemical \\npathways that signal the muscle cell to grow.\\nTraining with very high reps causes a greater flow \\nof blood to the trained muscles. It’s the muscle \\ncontraction that stimulates the blood to be directed \\nin that direction. During the superpump program, \\nworkouts focus on just one or two muscle groups \\nper session (see table 7.8). Each muscle group \\nwill be trained just once a week with high reps \\nand multiple sets. The workouts focus on isolation \\nexercises and cables for constant tension and \\nemploy techniques such as preexhaust, supersets, \\ncompound sets, tri-sets, and drop sets. Keep rest \\nto no more than 90 seconds between sets or as \\nspecified for each training protocol.

For some, this is due to an \\nimbalance in their overall muscle development—\\noften caused by genetics or improper training. For \\nothers, this is due to simple desire for having cer-\\ntain muscle groups (often the biceps) as large as \\npossible. If you have a particular muscle group that \\nyou want to concentrate on developing, try one of \\nthe following muscle-specific programs. There is a \\nspecific program for each major muscle group. Each \\nprogram is tried and true in application and results.\\nBig Chest Program\\nBig pecs are the signature body part of a serious \\nbodybuilder. If your chest is a weak spot on your \\nphysique, try following the big chest program \\nshown in table 7.9. It is a 16-week program broken \\ndown into four separate phases that alter exercise \\nselection, training techniques used, weight and rep \\nranges, number of sets, and even rest periods.\\nDuring this program you should alternate between \\na four-day and five-day training split. During weeks 1, \\n3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 you will train chest twice \\nper week while training all other muscle groups just \\nonce. For this you will use a four-day split that trains \\nchest and abs on Monday and Friday; shoulders \\nand triceps on Tuesday; back, biceps, and abs on \\nWednesday; and legs and calves on Thursday. During \\nweeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 you train chest once \\nper week using a five-day split that works chest and \\nabs on Monday; legs and calves on Tuesday; shoul-\\nders and abs on Wednesday; back on Thursday; and \\nbiceps, triceps, and abs on Friday.\\nPhase 1 is designed to build mass and strength; \\ntherefore, it involves mainly compound exercises \\ndone for low reps. Phase 2 develops muscle size \\nand separation by increasing the number of isola-\\ntion exercises and reps performed per set. Phase \\n3 is designed to shape and define the muscle \\nyou built in the first eight weeks by increasing the \\nreps used again and incorporating compound sets. \\nPhase 4, the final phase, is a combination of the \\nthree prior phases. It uses only heavy pressing \\nexercises for two of the workouts during weeks 13 \\nTABLE 7.9 Big Chest Program\\nPHASE 4: WEEKS 13-16\\nRest 60 seconds between sets during weeks 13 and \\n15; 2 minutes between sets during weeks 14 and 16.\\nMONDAY (WEEKS 13 AND 15)\\nExercise Sets Reps\\nBench press 4 4-6\\nIncline press 4 6-8\\nDecline press 4 8-10\\nFRIDAY (WEEKS 13 AND 15)\\nIncline fly 4 12-15\\nFlat fly 4 12-15\\nPec deck fly 4 12-15\\nMONDAY (WEEKS 14 AND 16)\\nIncline dumbbell fly 4 10-12\\nCompound set with incline press 4 8-10\\nPec deck 4 12-15\\nCompound set with machine bench \\npress\\n4 10-12\\nPHASE 1: WEEKS 1-4\\nRest 60 to 120 seconds between sets.\\nExercise Sets Reps\\nCable crossover (prefatigue) 1 25\\nIncline barbell bench press 3 6\\nFlat dumbbell press 4 6\\nDecline barbell press 4 6\\nDumbbell pullovers 3 6\\nPHASE 2: WEEKS 5-8\\nRest about 60 seconds between sets.\\nDecline push-up (prefatigue) 1 25\\nDecline dumbbell press 3 8-10\\nIncline dumbbell press 4 8-10\\nFlat dumbbell fly 4 8-10\\nCable crossover 3 8-10\\nPHASE 3: WEEKS 9-12\\nRest 30 to 60 seconds between sets.\\nPec deck 1 25\\nFlat dumbbell press 3 12-15\\nIncline dumbbell fly 3 12-15\\nCompound set with cable crossover 3 12-15\\nDecline barbell press 3 12-15\\nCompound set with pullover 3 12-15'),\n",

The lower half of the body seems \\nto get neglected in an effort to focus on the more \\nobvious muscle groups of the upper body, such as \\nthe arms and chest. If you’ve been guilty of neglect-\\ning your leg training, or if you are wise enough to \\nrealize that muscular legs are just as important \\nas a muscular upper body to produce a balanced \\nphysique, try this big wheels program to pack on \\nmuscle to your quads and hams.\\nThe 16-week big wheels program (see table 7.10) \\nis broken down into four 4-week phases. Phase \\n1 kicks off with a high-intensity training (HIT) leg \\nprogram that uses heavy weight. As discussed in \\nchapter 6, this training method uses high-intensity \\nmethods and low volume. Precede each set with \\none short warm-up set with approximately 50 per-\\ncent of the weight you will use for the working set. \\nTake each working set to muscle failure. In addition, \\nyou should have a spotter help you perform three \\nor four forced reps after reaching muscle failure. \\nResist the negative portion on every forced rep. \\nPerform the HIT leg workout on Monday and Friday \\n(add abs following the Friday workout). Train chest, \\nback, and abs on Tuesday; train shoulders, biceps, \\nand triceps on Wednesday. Take Thursday off.\\nPhase 2 training drops the workouts back to \\none per week as the volume and reps increase \\ndramatically. It also uses supersets and preexhaust \\ntechniques to keep the intensity high. This phase \\nshould be done as a five-day split, training legs \\non Monday; chest and abs on Tuesday; shoulders \\nand traps on Wednesday; back on Thursday; and \\ntriceps, biceps, and calves on Friday. In addition to \\nthis training in the gym, in phase 2 you kick-start the \\n50–50 method for dumbbell squats (see chapter \\n6 for details). You will follow the 50–50 program \\nthrough phase 3 for a total of eight weeks. Use light \\ndumbbells and perform one set of 50 reps of dumb-\\nbell squats in the morning and at night, every day.\\nPhase 3 drops the reps down to 10 to 12 per \\nset, except on leg extensions where you will do \\nthree sets of 21 (see chapter 6 for details). Leg \\ntraining goes back to twice per week as you’ll use \\nthe same split in weeks 1 to 4.\\nTABLE 7.10 Big Wheels Program\\nPHASE 1: WEEKS 1-4\\nExercise Sets Reps\\nLeg extension 1 10-12\\nSmith machine squat 1 6-8\\nLeg press 1 6-8\\nHack squat 1 6-8\\nRomanian deadlift 1 6-8\\nLying leg curl 1 10-12\\nSeated leg curl 1 10-12\\nStanding calf raise 1 12-15\\nSeated calf raise 1 12-15\\nLeg press calf raise 1 12-15\\nPHASE 2: WEEKS 5-8\\nLeg extension 5 20\\nSuperset with lying leg curl 5 20\\nSquats 5 20\\nLeg press 5 20\\nRomanian deadlift 5 20\\nPHASE 3: WEEKS 9-12\\nSquat 4 10-12\\nHack squat 4 10-12\\nLeg extension 3 21s\\nLying leg curl 4 10-12\\nStanding calf raise 4 10-12\\nCompound set with donkey calf raise 4 10-12\\nPHASE 4: WEEKS 13-16\\nMORNING: QUADS\\nLeg extension 3 8-10\\nSquat 3 8-10\\nLeg press 3 8-10\\nHack squat 3 8-10\\nWalking lunge 3 20\\nOne-leg leg extension 3 8-10\\nEVENING: HAMSTRINGS, CALVES\\nLying leg curl 3 8-10\\nRomanian deadlift 3 8-10\\nStanding leg curl 3 8-10\\nSeated leg curl 3 8-10\\nSeated calf raise 3 8-10\\nDonkey calf raise 3 8-10\\nStanding calf raise 3 8-10\\nLeg press calf raise 3 8-10'),\n",

Because \\nof this, the volume is very high, with multiple exer-\\ncises for each muscle group. Follow the same split \\nas done in phase 2. The reps drop back to 8 to \\n10 per set for optimal muscle gains.\\nCalves to Cows Program\\nCalves seem to be the one muscle group of the \\nlower body that few bodybuilders have developed \\nto their satisfaction, and it’s also the one muscle \\ngroup that so many want to develop. Unfortunately, \\nif you aren’t genetically predisposed to building \\nbig calves, you will have to work extremely hard \\nfor every ounce of muscle you can add to them. \\nThe calves to cows program (see table 7.11) is for \\nthose bodybuilders who need to work their calves \\nhard and diligently. This program is divided into four \\n4-week phases that change up the rep range and \\nweight used, the volume, and the training frequency \\nin a specific pattern. Each phase reduces the fre-\\nquency at which you train the calves as well as the \\nrep range, but it increases the volume (number of \\nsets and exercises performed) and weight used.\\nPhase 1 starts off with training the calves five \\ndays a week. Use a basic five-day training split \\nduring this phase and train calves at the end of \\nevery workout. Reps are extremely high but volume \\nis fairly low. Phase 2 increases the exercise number \\nand the sets performed to four per exercise, but it \\ndrops the training frequency back to four days per \\nweek. You can use a four- or five-day training split \\nduring this phase. Reps decrease to about 15 to \\n20 per set. In phase 3, the frequency decreases \\nto three times per week, but an extra calf exer -\\ncise is added and compound-set training is used. \\nReps drop down to 12 to 15 per set. You can use \\na three-, four-, or five-day basic training split during \\nthis period of calf training. The final phase, phase 4, \\ntrains calves only twice per week. Sounds simple, \\nbut it increases the number of exercises performed \\nand includes drop sets on the last set of every \\nexercise. After you reach failure on the last set, \\ndrop the weight about 30 percent and repeat that \\ntwice. You can do this phase with any type of split.\\nSix Weeks to Sick Arms\\nRegardless of where you’re starting from, this \\nsix-week program will put noticeable size on your \\narms. You might expect to add an inch or more to \\nthe arms. This six-week program is a progression \\nthat ramps up the training frequency (how often you \\ntrain arms each week) starting at once per week in \\nweek 1, twice per week in week 2, and three times \\nper week in weeks 3 through 5, and then backing \\nway off in the final week 6 to just once per week \\nagain. There is a method to this madness.\\nWeek one will annihilate your biceps and triceps. \\nYou’ll pull out all the stops, using negative-rep train-\\ning to destroy every single muscle fiber in the arms. \\nYou’ll need a good week to recover from this. The \\nnext week gets involves light weight and high reps. \\nVolume will be low on these workouts because \\nyou’ll still be recovering from the previous week. \\nThese workouts will help you to recover from the \\nprevious week and will get you ready for the crazy \\nthree weeks that are to come. In weeks 3, 4, and 5 \\nyou will be hitting arms three times per week. If you \\nthink that sounds like overtraining, you're right. But \\novertraining does not happen immediately. It takes \\nseveral weeks to actually become overtrained.

And what's interesting about \\noverreaching is that research shows that if your diet \\nis adequate in calories, protein, and carbohydrate, \\nas well as the right supplements, then you can \\nactually capitalize on overreaching and turn it into a \\nway to get bigger and stronger. But don't worry. I've \\ngot you covered on a diet and supplement plan to \\nensure that you turn the training into distinct gains. \\nSeveral studies from the University of Connecticut \\n(Ratamess et al. 2003; Kraemer et al. 2006) have \\nshown that when participants overreach for several \\nweeks, during the two weeks following, they grow \\nsignificantly bigger and stronger while taking it easy. \\nThe key is to stop the overreaching just before it \\nturns into overtraining. That’s why you’ll be training \\narms three times per week in weeks 3 through 5 \\nand then switch it up to just once per week in week \\n6. I also suggest that the week after week 6 you \\ntake it fairly easy on your arms and train them just \\nonce that week before getting back into any serious \\ntraining programs.\\nNot only will the three-day-a-week arm training \\nshock your muscles into growing with frequent and \\nintense workouts that cause overreaching, but it \\nalso takes advantage of the staircase effect for \\nbuilding muscle. This refers to the fact that training \\nactivates genes in muscle fibers that are respon-\\nsible for many of the adaptations that take place, \\nsuch as muscle growth and increased strength. \\nFor example, consistent training activates certain \\ngenes that result in building more muscle fiber \\nprotein, which means more size and strength. \\nThese genes are typically activated a few hours, \\nand some remain activated for days. Repeated \\nworkouts, if timed appropriately, can build on the \\nactivation of the genes to reach an even higher \\nactivity level and thus greater muscle growth. \\nThis is referred to as the staircase effect.\\n\\xa0In other \\nwords, let’s say a certain gene involved in muscle \\ngrowth is activated by a workout to the point that \\nthat its activity is boosted by 100 percent after the \\nworkout, then slowly declines in activity over the \\nnext few days so that the day after the workout it is \\nstill up by 75 percent, and the second day after the \\nworkout it is up by 50 percent, then the third day it \\nis up by just 25 percent, and finally on the fourth \\nday after the workout it is back to the original level. \\nIf you performed the workout on the fourth day after \\nthe first workout or later, then that gene would be \\nbumped back to 100 percent of its original activ-\\nity. However, if you worked out on the second day \\nafter the first workout, when the gene was still up \\nby 50 percent, then you could potentially bump up \\nits activity to 150 percent. This could lead to even \\ngreater muscle growth and strength gains than if \\nyou waited to train again after the fourth day or \\nlater, such as one week later. This is one reason \\ntraining a muscle group every 48 hours could lead \\nto even greater muscle growth and strength gains \\nthan training every seven days.\\nOf course, this program is not all about training \\nfrequency. While moving to more frequent workouts \\ncan help you to build extra size on your arms, to \\nreally get them up there in size will require pulling \\nout all the stops. So intensity techniques, like drop \\nsets, forced reps, rest, negative reps, and super-\\nsets, will be key in forcing them to grow. These \\ntechniques not only put more stress on the muscle, \\nbut they are also known to boost growth hormone \\nlevels. In fact, one study from Finland (Ahtianen et \\nal. 2003) reported that participants doing forced \\nreps increased GH levels three times higher than \\nwhen they just stopped after reaching muscle fail-\\nure. That extra growth hormone will be put to good \\nuse initiating muscle recovery and growth. Yarrow \\net al. (2007) reported that using negative-rep train-\\ning leads to high GH levels. Another key element \\nto this program is the constant switching up of \\nweight and rep ranges every workout (undulating \\nperiodization) to keep your arms growing.\\nBecause you’ll be training arms pretty much \\nevery other day during weeks 3, 4, and 5, you may \\nbe worried about your arms still being sore when \\nyou train them. Don’t be. Nosaka and Newton \\n(2002) showed that when participants work out \\nintensely to cause muscle pain and train that \\nmuscle again just two days later and again four \\ndays later when the muscle is still sore, it does \\nnot impede recovery. Plus this can actually help \\nmuscles grow. Pullinen et al. (2002) found that \\nwhen participants trained the same muscle group \\njust two days, the catabolic hormone cortisol was \\nlower. Since cortisol competes with testosterone, \\nhaving lower cortisol levels during and after work-\\nouts can make you more anabolic and allow your \\ntestosterone to better enhance muscle growth.\\nTo properly hit your arms during these six \\nweeks, you’ll need to alternate your training split. \\nEach week you will follow a four-day training split. \\nHowever, based on the week and number of times \\nyou are training arms, you will be training on four \\ndays of the week and pairing up different muscle \\ngroups each week.

It’s also an import-\\nant area to develop for strength in all other exer-\\ncises. This 16-week program can help you build \\nup a weak back (see table 7.14). Phase 1 uses \\npull-ups as a warm-up and deadlifts, rows, and \\ngood mornings to build a strong back. Reps are \\nlow to encourage strength gains, and the volume \\nis low because you do this workout twice a week \\nduring this phase on Monday and Friday along \\nwith abs. Do chest, shoulders, and calves on \\nTuesday; biceps, triceps, and abs on Wednesday; \\nand legs on Thursday. Phase 2 increases the \\nvolume and decreases the frequency to once \\nper week. Train chest, shoulders, and abs on \\nMonday. The compound sets add another level \\nof challenge, which means the back muscles will \\nneed a full week of recovery during this phase. \\nPhase 3 is done twice per week with the same \\ntraining split that is used in phase 1. The Monday \\nand Friday workouts are different. The Monday \\nworkout focuses on rowing exercises done with'),\n",

Since the deltoid muscle is composed \\nof three heads, a well-balanced shoulder program \\nshould target all three heads. The cannonball \\ndelts program (see table 7.15) drives growth in \\nall three heads in order to build deltoids that are \\nmassive and balanced. Phase 1 starts with a basic \\nstrength and mass program done twice per week \\non Monday and Friday along with traps and abs. \\nThe Monday workout is a barbell blasting workout \\nand the Friday workout is done with all dumbbells. \\nTrain legs and calves on Tuesday; chest, triceps, \\nTABLE 7.14 Wider Is Better Back Program\\nheavier weight and low reps. The Friday workout, \\non the other hand, focuses on pull-ups and pull -\\ndowns with lighter weight and higher reps. This \\nworkout should be one giant set cycled through \\ntwice. Phase 4 is a cable-ready program that \\nhits the lats from a variety of angles with all \\ncable moves. This keeps maximal tension on \\nthe muscles throughout the full range of motion. \\nReps are higher, and you should do drop sets \\non the last set of each cable exercise. Do this \\nworkout once per week with a split similar to the \\none used in phase 2. At the end of phase 4 you \\ncan switch to a more basic back workout using \\nthe split you typically train with.\\nand abs on Wednesday; and back and biceps on \\nThursday. Both are done with low reps and low \\nvolume. Phase 2 drops the frequency back to once \\nper week as the intensity is ratcheted up with high-\\nrep, high-volume training that uses the preexhaust \\ntechnique. Train chest, triceps, and abs on Monday; \\nshoulders and traps on Wednesday; legs on Thurs-\\nday; and back, biceps, and abs on Friday.

From a training \\nstandpoint, the total volume and reps performed \\nper set tend to be lower when training for strength \\ncompared to the volume and number of reps when \\ntraining for muscle mass. From a physiological \\nstandpoint, muscle growth tends to be more about \\nthe aftereffects of training, while muscle strength \\nalso has a learning component that develops \\nduring the actual workouts. Even though mechan-\\nical stress and metabolic stress are important \\nfactors for developing muscle strength, there is \\na large component to strength development that \\nrelies on training of the nervous system.\\nMotor nerves that run from the spinal cord to the \\nmuscle fibers are responsible for initiating muscle \\ncontractions. Strength training increases muscle \\nstrength through several adaptations of the motor \\nnerves. One mechanism involves training the \\nmotor nerves to fire at a faster rate. This allows \\nthe muscle fibers to contract with more force (that \\nis, greater strength). Strength training also trains \\nthe motor nerves to fire at this faster rate for a \\nlonger period without fatiguing, This allows more \\nreps to be done with a certain amount of weight. \\nAnother mechanism that leads to enhanced \\nstrength is synchronization of motor nerves. This \\nrefers to the ability of motor nerves that control \\nvarious muscle fibers within the same muscle to \\nfire at the precise time to allow for the greatest \\nproduction of muscle force.\\nWhat is similar between training programs for \\nmaximizing muscle strength and programs for \\nmaximizing muscle growth is that both trial and \\nerror in the gym and research in the laboratory have \\ndefined the training techniques and programs that \\nwork best at encouraging strength gains. Part III will \\nteach you how to train for maximal strength. Chap-\\nter 8 covers basic workouts for building strength. \\nThis chapter starts with a lesson on weekly train-\\ning splits that are optimal for building strength \\nregardless of your training schedule.

The variables you \\nwill need to consider for developing strength train-\\ning workouts, as discussed in chapter 2, are the \\nchoice of exercises you will perform, the order of \\nthose exercises, how many sets of each exercise \\nyou will do, how heavy a weight you will use on \\nthose exercises, and how much rest you will allow \\nbetween sets. Furthermore, you will also need to \\nconsider how often to train each muscle group and \\nwhat type of training split you will employ.\\nThis chapter focuses on the common training \\nsplits used by lifters interested in maximizing \\nmuscle strength. This will help you determine \\nthe best weekly schedule to follow for increasing \\nmuscle strength. From there the chapter steps \\nback to focus on the variables of each workout. \\nThen it steps back again to focus on the details of \\nthe specific exercises. Each step gives you more \\ndetail regarding guidelines, techniques, and tips \\nfor maximizing your muscle strength.\\nWEEKLY SPLITS\\nRegardless of whether your goal is to develop \\nstrength or muscle mass, the easiest way to split \\nup your training is to work within the confines of \\nthe week. Although the body doesn’t specifically \\nfollow a seven-day cycle, for practical purposes, \\na seven-day strength training cycle makes sense \\nwith most people’s schedules. The following splits \\nfor developing strength all follow a seven-day cycle \\nand will fit anyone’s schedule and level of strength \\ntraining experience.\\nOne common denominator of these splits is \\nthat they focus on training three major strength \\nlifts—the bench press (the marker for upper-\\nbody strength), squats (the marker for lower-body \\nstrength), and deadlifts (the marker for overall \\nbody strength). These also are the three lifts \\nthat are involved in powerlifting competition. \\nTypically, the resistance used on these three \\nexercises is expressed as a percentage of the \\nweightlifter’s one-repetition max (1RM), while all \\nother exercises are expressed as an RM target \\nzone—the resistance that limits a lifter to a \\nspecific number of repetitions. This is because \\npowerlifters and others interested in training for \\nstrength frequently test their 1RM on the three \\nmajor exercises.\\nBecause training for maximal strength typically \\ninvolves training with the three major strength \\nexercises, as opposed to training a multitude of \\nmuscle groups, there tend to be fewer commonly \\nused training splits. This does not mean that there \\nare a limited number of ways to split up a strength \\ntraining program. The following training splits are \\nthose that are well accepted by the majority of \\nstrength experts and athletes.\\nWhole-Body Strength Training\\nWhole-body strength training refers to single \\nworkouts that stress most major muscle groups \\nof the body. This training split allows for most \\nmajor muscle groups to be trained three times \\nper week—usually Monday, Wednesday, and \\nFriday. Many experts believe that frequency of \\ntraining is important for gaining strength. In fact, \\nmany strength coaches have their athletes follow'),\n",

Not only do they \\nthink the frequency of training is important, but \\nmost also believe that because the body works \\nas a whole unit, it should be trained accordingly. \\nTherefore, a whole-body strength training split \\ncan be an effective means of increasing overall \\nstrength.\\nThe frequency offered by whole-body strength \\ntraining is also beneficial for beginners. As dis -\\ncussed in chapter 5, this is because the initial \\nadaptations made in a strength training program \\ninvolve the training of the nervous system. The \\nbest way for beginners to train to build strength \\nis to use slightly higher repetitions than trained \\nlifters use and more frequent training of the same \\nexercises to program their nervous systems.\\nThe workouts on a whole-body split typically \\ninclude one exercise per major muscle group. The \\nexercise choices usually include the bench press, \\nsquat, and deadlift, or similar exercises that mimic \\nthose particular exercises, as well as assistance \\nexercises that help with increasing strength on \\nthese particular exercises. Most weightlifters who \\nuse a whole-body split do not train small muscle \\ngroups (such as traps, forearms, and calves) in \\norder to better concentrate on the muscles that \\nare directly involved in the bench press, squat, \\nand deadlift.\\nWhen you are following a whole-body training \\nsplit, the first exercise of the workout should \\nalternate between the bench press, squat, and \\ndeadlift. That way, each major strength exercise \\nis trained once per week when the body is fresh. \\nSome powerlifters also include one extra assis -\\ntance exercise for the exercise they are focusing \\non in that workout.

Each split trains the entire body in two \\ndays, which allows for four workouts per week. \\nThe major difference that separates max \\neffort–dynamic effort from upper- and lower-body \\ntraining split is the specific amount of resistance \\nused during the max effort–dynamic effort split. \\nFor details of the max effort–dynamic effort \\nmethod, see chapter 9.\\nWith the max effort–dynamic effort training split, \\nthe first two workouts of the week are done using \\nthe max effort system (see table 8.4).

Some lifters go \\nto 100 percent on some workouts.\\nDuring the last two workouts of the week, the \\nweight used on the bench press, squat, and dead-\\nlift is only 50 to 60 percent of the 1RM. Although \\nmost people can lift this amount of weight for about \\n20 reps, these sets stop at 3 to 5 reps.

All focus \\non training the three major strength lifts; a secondary focus is on training the assistance exercises \\nfor these three strength lifts. Because of this, changing the strength training split every few months \\nis one way to institute another form of variation in the training program. However, most competitive \\npowerlifters have one training split that they stick with year round. Therefore, if you find a certain \\ntraining split that works better for your schedule, you can potentially use it endlessly.\\nESSENTIALS OF STRENGTH \\nPROGRAMS\\nThe type of training split you decide to follow is \\nnot as critical a factor for successful strength \\ngains as the proper choice of exercises, exercise \\norder, resistance, and volume. Regardless of the \\nsplit you employ for developing strength, there \\nare certain rules of success to follow. Follow \\nthese general rules to ensure that your training is \\noptimal for strength gains. In addition, the three \\nmajor strength lifts are covered in detail. That’s \\nbecause you can’t properly increase your strength \\non these lifts without being proficient in the proper \\ntechnique for each. Last but not least, the chapter \\ncovers core training. You must have a strong core \\nto transfer strength to the limbs. Once you have \\nthese fundamentals of strength training, you will \\nbe ready to advance to the techniques for boosting \\nstrength (chapter 9).\\nGeneral Rules of Strength Training\\nTraining for muscle mass uses exercises as a \\nmeans to an end. Training for maximal strength, \\non the other hand, does not use exercises merely \\nas tools. Instead, training for strength is about \\nincreasing performance on the exercises. For most \\nweightlifters, the exercises they train are the bench \\npress, squat, and deadlift. Therefore, the first and \\nmost obvious rule is that you should include these \\nthree exercises in your program. You should also \\ninclude assistance exercises to help you boost \\nstrength on the bench press, squat, and deadlift. \\nThese choices involve multijoint compound exer -\\ncises, where appropriate.\\nOrder of exercises is important as well—the \\nbench press, squat, and deadlift should each be \\nperformed first in the workout at least once per \\nweek. Following the major lift should be the assis-\\ntance exercises. The second exercise should be a \\ncompound exercise that targets the major muscle \\ngroup used in each of the three exercises. The \\nthird exercise and any others that follow should \\nbe those that target muscle groups that assist the \\nmajor strength exercise.\\nThe amount of resistance used is of paramount \\nimportance to your strength gains. For the three \\nmajor strength exercises, the resistance used is \\ntypically expressed as a percent of the 1RM. This \\nis convenient because the 1RM for these lifts is \\nfrequently tested by those who are interested in \\nincreasing their maximal strength. For strength \\ngains, the majority of training time should be spent \\nusing a load between 85 and 95 percent of the \\n1RM. Of course, cycling the training load is wise \\nfor making continued gains in strength. In fact, \\nloads as light as 50 percent RM are often used \\nby weightlifters to increase power, which helps to \\nboost strength. The resistance for the assistance \\nexercises is usually expressed as a specific repe-\\ntition maximum (RM). These will often correspond \\nwith the percent RM. For example, if the squat \\nis being trained with 85 percent of the RM, the \\nleg press should be performed using a rep range \\nof about four to six. Regardless of the exercise, \\nmuscle failure should be reached only on one set \\nper exercise at the maximum. Many powerlifters \\nrarely, if ever, train to muscle failure. However, \\nresearch from Australia suggests that training \\nto muscle failure on one set per exercise and no \\nmore is better for strength gains than not training \\nto failure or training to failure two or more times \\nper exercise (Drinkwater et al. 2005).\\nVolume per workout is generally low when train-\\ning for strength. For the major strength exercises, \\ntypically as few as three to as many as eight sets \\nare done per exercise. For assistance exercises, \\nusually three or four sets are performed per exer-\\ncise. For an entire workout, total volume can be as \\nlow as 12 to as high as 30 sets or more, depending \\non the split being used and the training phase.'),\n",

Research and years of experience \\nsupport a narrow spectrum of exercise choices, \\nexercise order, resistance, volume, and even rest \\nperiods that are effective in the quest for strength. \\nYet, as the saying goes, rules are meant to be \\nbroken. As important as it is to follow rules for \\nstrength training, breaking from the norm from time \\nto time can be an effective means of improving \\nstrength. This is especially true during plateaus, \\nwhen standard training practices fail to work. The \\ntraining strategies in chapter 9 will challenge the \\ntried-and-true rules that most strength athletes \\nhave adopted as standard training guidelines. \\nKnowing how and when to use them will make a \\nworld of difference in the strength gains you can \\nexpect from your training program.\\nBench Press Training\\nTo many people, strength is all about the bench \\npress. Rarely does a heavily muscled athlete field \\nthe question “How much can you squat?” The \\nquestion everyone wants to know is “How much \\ncan you bench-press?” Of course, masculinity is \\noften associated with strong and well-developed \\nupper-body musculature, and the bench press \\nis the marker for this strength. The bench press \\ndevelops the major muscles of the upper body—\\nchest, shoulders, triceps, and even the back to \\nsome extent.\\nAnother reason so many people associate \\nstrength solely with the bench press may be the \\nfact that of the three major strength exercises, \\nthe bench press is the easiest to perform. Almost \\nanyone can walk into a gym and bench-press with \\nrelative ease and safety. Whatever the reason, the \\nbench press is the preeminent strength exercise.\\nWhen it comes to training strategies for boost-\\ning strength in the bench press, regardless of \\nthe training split being used, exercise choice and \\norder are critical factors. Of course, strength in \\nthe bench press cannot be optimally enhanced \\nwithout actually performing the bench press reg -\\nularly. This is known as the specificity principle. \\nOn bench press training days, you should perform \\nthe bench press first while the muscle fibers are \\nfully recovered from any previous exercise. This \\nensures that the muscles can handle the maximal \\nload they are capable of for the specific number \\nof reps prescribed for that workout.\\nAfter the bench press, you should do one other \\nchest-pressing assistance exercise, such as the \\nincline or decline barbell press or dumbbell press \\n(flat, incline, or decline). On occasion, you can do \\nchest isolation exercises instead. However, isola-\\ntion exercises are rarely used unless the weight -\\nlifter is in the hypertrophy phase of training. This \\nis because the isolation exercises do not mimic \\nthe pressing motion of the bench press. Chest \\nexercises are usually followed with one shoulder \\nexercise and one triceps exercise. These are pref-\\nerentially compound exercises, such as shoulder \\npress or upright row for shoulders and dips or \\nclose-grip bench press for triceps. On occasion \\nthese can be isolation exercises. Depending on \\nthe split used, one back and one biceps exercise \\nmay conclude the bench press workout, or you \\nmay train these on separate pull exercise days. \\nSee table 8.6 for a sample bench press workout.\\nSets performed on the bench press should typi-\\ncally fall in the range of three to five, not including \\nwarm-up sets. All assistance exercises are usually \\nlimited to three sets per exercise. The weight used \\non the bench press should start off light (10 to 50 \\npercent RM) and gradually work up to the heavy \\nsets in the range of 85 to 95 percent RM. This is \\nthe range that most workouts are performed in, \\nTABLE 8.6 Big Bench Day\\nThis workout is for a powerlifter who has a maximum \\nbench press of 495 pounds and is training with 90 \\npercent of his or her maximum.\\nExercise Sets\\nWeight \\n(pounds) Reps Rest\\nBench press 1 135 10* 1 min\\n1 225 8* 1 min\\n1 315 6* 2 min\\n1 365 5* 2 min\\n1 405 3* 3 min\\n3 445 3** 3-4 min\\nIncline bench \\npress\\n3 375 4-6** 3 min\\nBarbell shoulder \\npress\\n3 255 4-6** 3 min\\nClose-grip bench \\npress\\n3 385 4-6** 3 min\\nStanding crunch 4 110 8-10** 1 min\\n*Warm-up sets.\\n**Working sets.'),\n",

This helps to stabilize your \\nbody. Your knees should be bent at about a 90-degree angle.\\nMaintain a slight arch in your lower back throughout the \\nexercise and keep your shoulders and glutes pressed into \\nthe bench. Keep your glute muscles tightly contracted during \\nthe entire exercise.\\nGRIP\\nTake a grip that is slightly wider than shoulder width on the bar. \\nTo determine the best grip for your arm length, make sure that \\nwhen the bar reaches your chest there is a 90-degree angle at \\nthe shoulder and the elbow.\\nBe sure to wrap your thumb around the bar. Make sure you \\nsqueeze the bar as hard as possible. This creates a solid \\nconnection to the bar by allowing the force developed by the \\nchest, shoulder, and triceps muscles to be more effectively \\ntransmitted to the bar.\\nLOWERING THE BAR\\nLift the bar off the rack to the point where it is over your upper \\nchest. This is your starting position.\\nSqueeze your scapulae together while lowering the bar. This \\nstabilizes the shoulder girdle and will help you recruit the lats \\nto push the weight up.\\nLower the bar slowly. This allows the stored energy from the \\ndescent and the elastic properties of the muscles to produce \\nmore force on the lift.\\ndepending on the training phase. Weight may go as \\nhigh as 100 percent RM to as low as 50 percent \\nRM for some working sets during specific training \\nphases of the cycle. For the assistance exercises, \\nreps typically correspond with the percent RM \\nbeing used in that workout on the bench press. \\nSo reps tend to fall mostly in the range of 2 to 10 \\nreps for assistance exercises, depending on the \\ntraining phase.\\nRest periods between sets should be longer \\nthan when training for muscle size. The exact \\ntime is not as critical as the fact that the body \\nis mostly recovered from the previous set. When \\ntraining for strength, fatigue is not as critical as \\nit is for building muscle size. Therefore, resting \\nanywhere from two to five minutes is common \\npractice. A detailed description of the proper exer-\\ncise technique for the bench press exercise can \\nbe found in the Big Bench Tips box and in chapter \\n14. Technique is a critical factor when training for \\nstrength. The program you follow will not matter \\nmuch to your strength gains if you do not perfect \\nyour technique in the bench press.\\nSquat Training\\nThe squat is the exercise that defines lower-body \\nstrength. Although it’s categorized as a leg exercise, \\nthe squat technically functions as a whole-body \\nstrength and mass builder. It has been estimated \\nthat more than 200 muscles are involved in exe -\\ncuting the squat. In addition, the surge in growth \\na\\nb'),\n",

This stabilizes your shoulder capsule and keeps the bar moving upward in a straight line.\\nYou need to explode the weight off your chest as quickly and powerfully as possible. Think about \\nblasting the bar off your chest as if it weighed just 10 pounds, even though, in reality, the bar will move \\nquite slowly. The neural drive that results from attempting to move the bar as quickly as possible will \\nrecruit more high-threshold muscle fibers.\\nPress the bar straight up or back slightly toward your head. As you press the bar up, try to rip the \\nbar apart by pulling your arms outward without changing your grip on the bar.\\nLEGS\\nAlthough the bench press is an upper-body exercise, don’t forget to use your legs. When you press \\nthe weight with your arms, you should also drive the weight with your legs to transfer more force to \\nyour upper body.\\nBREATHING\\nTake a big breath in and hold it as you lower the weight and start it on its return. This causes an \\nincrease in pressure in your chest and abdominal cavity, which better supports your body and allows \\nyour muscles to produce more force. It also expands the chest, shortening the distance the bar has \\nto travel.\\nExhale after passing the most difficult stage of the lift or after you reach the top position.\\nhormone and testosterone that accompanies the \\nsquat as compared to other exercises means it \\nenhances the strength and growth of all muscles. \\nMany great bench pressers espouse the impor -\\ntance of doing squats, if for nothing more than \\nenhancing bench press strength.\\nTo increase squat strength, the first critical \\ncomponent of any training program is the exercise \\nchoices and order. Simply stated, you have to actu-\\nally squat to increase squat strength. On workouts \\nthat emphasize squat training, the squat should be \\nthe first exercise performed. When you’re training \\nfor strength, the amount of weight you use is a \\ncritical factor for strength gains. Therefore, you \\nshould do the squat first, when the muscles are \\nnot fatigued and are at their strongest.\\nYou should follow the squat with one assistance \\nsquat or leg press exercise (such as the leg press \\nor squat machine) and occasionally an isolation \\nexercise for quadriceps (such as the leg exten -\\nsion). In addition, many weightlifters also perform \\none or two calf exercises at the end of their squat \\nworkouts. This is sensible, since the calf muscles \\nare involved during the squat.\\nTotal sets performed for squats during squat \\nworkouts should be about three to five, not includ-\\ning warm-up sets. All assistance exercises are usu-\\nally limited to three sets per exercise. Weight for \\nthe squat exercise should progressively increase \\nfrom light warm-up sets with weight around 10 to \\n50 percent RM to heavy working sets of 85 to 95 \\npercent RM.

Because you must hold the \\nbar in the hands while driving it upward from the \\nfloor with the legs, it truly involves a majority of \\nthe body’s musculature. It is called the deadlift \\nbecause the weight is lifted from the floor. This \\neliminates the eccentric motion that precedes \\nmost exercises such as the squat and bench \\npress. The eccentric motion aids the force that \\nis produced by the muscles during the concentric \\nphase of a lift. Therefore, the deadlift is a much \\nmore difficult lift than the squat.\\nAs with the squat and bench press, to increase \\nyour strength on the deadlift, you must train the \\ndeadlift. This means that you must devote at \\nleast one workout per week to specific deadlift \\ntraining. You should perform the deadlift first \\nin the workout when the muscles are strongest \\nand not fatigued. Many powerlifters follow the \\ndeadlift exercise with assistance hamstring \\nexercises such as the Romanian deadlift or leg \\ncurl. Depending on the training split used, many \\npowerlifters also train back and sometimes \\nbiceps on deadlift day. This strategy makes \\nsense, since these muscle groups are used \\nduring the deadlift.\\nUsually about three to five sets, not including \\nwarm-up sets, are performed for the deadlift. \\nAll assistance exercises, such as the leg curl, \\nare usually limited to three sets per exercise. \\nAs with the other two strength exercises, the \\nweight on the deadlift should progressively \\nincrease from very light warm-up sets (weight \\naround 10 to 50 percent RM) to heavy working \\nsets (ranging from 85 to 95 percent RM). This \\nis the range that most lifters use in training the \\ndeadlift. However, the weight used during some \\nworkouts may go as high as 100 percent RM or \\nas low as 50 percent RM for working sets. For \\nassistance exercises, reps typically correspond \\nSTANCE\\nPlace your feet shoulder-width apart or wider—this depends on your preference. Individual bio -\\nmechanics come into play, and you must find the foot position that is most comfortable for you. \\nIf your feet are too close together, it makes it difficult for the hamstrings and glutes to properly \\nassist the quads. If your feet are too wide apart, the opposite will occur and your quads will not \\nbe able to assist. If you have long legs, going much wider than shoulder width tends to be more \\ncomfortable and more biomechanically advantageous. If you are of average height and have legs \\nthat are proportional to the length of your upper body, you will likely be comfortable with your feet \\njust slightly wider than shoulder width. If you have short legs, a shoulder-width stance will probably \\nbe most comfortable.\\nMaintain a slight bend in your knees and isometrically contract your quads, hamstrings, and glutes \\nbefore descending.\\nDESCENT\\nTo descend, stick your glutes out and descend as if you were to sit down on a chair until your thighs \\nare parallel to the floor or lower.\\nKeep your hips under the bar as much as possible to avoid excessive forward lean of your torso.\\nBe sure that your heels do not come off the floor.\\nASCENT\\nTransition from the descent to the ascent by driving forcefully upward with the legs. Concentrate on \\nmoving your hips first before your knees. As you push up, force your knees out hard and push out on \\nthe sides of your shoes while you squat. This helps to keep the tension in your hips for greater strength.\\nAs you ascend, thrust the head back. Don’t lift your chin up; just push your head back to help \\ncontract your traps.\\nBREATHING\\nTake a big breath in and hold it as you descend into the squat.\\nExhale as you pass the most difficult stage of the squat.'),\n",

And \\nso, when a standard program fails to deliver the \\nstrength gains you expect, it’s time to try some -\\nthing out of the ordinary.\\nThis chapter covers strength training methods \\nthat are effective for maximizing muscle strength. \\nAs in chapter 6, the techniques are categorized by \\nthe type of acute variable of training that is being \\nmanipulated in each workout. Also as in chapter \\n6, each technique is rated on a scale of 1 to 5 for \\nfour critical areas:\\n1. Time—the amount of time that the spe -\\ncific workout typically takes to complete. \\nThis helps you immediately determine if \\nthis training technique will fit your train -\\ning schedule. The higher the number, the \\nlonger the workouts for that specific tech-\\nnique will take to complete.\\n2. Length—the amount of time required to \\nfollow the program consistently for appre-\\nciable results to be noticed. This helps you \\ndetermine if you have the patience required \\nfor a certain program to demonstrate ade-\\nquate results in strength. The higher the \\nnumber, the longer this technique must be \\nfollowed for results to be realized.\\n3. Difficulty —the amount of weightlifting \\nexperience required to use the program \\neffectively. This helps you decide if you \\nhave enough training experience to take on \\nspecific strength training techniques. The \\nhigher the number, the more training exper-\\nience you should have before attempting \\nthat particular technique.\\n4. Results—how effective the program seems \\nto be for strength gains in most people. \\nThis helps you estimate how much strength \\nyou can expect to gain with each program. \\nThe higher the number, the greater the \\ngains in strength you can expect from a \\nparticular program.\\nEach strength training method provides a \\nsample table to show how this particular tech -\\nnique can be used. Some of these tables provide \\nfull training programs complete with sample \\nworkouts to be followed over several weeks. \\nOthers provide only brief details on cycling weight \\nthroughout the program. For these you are encour-\\naged to use a basic training program, as shown \\nin chapter 8, but incorporate the weight, rep, \\nset, or rest changes as outlined in the sample \\nprogram table. Try the advanced strength train -\\ning programs discussed in chapter 9 by cycling \\nthem into your training program along with the \\nbasic programs discussed in chapter 8. These \\nadvanced programs are great to turn to when \\nyour strength gains have reached a plateau. The \\nunorthodox nature of many of these programs \\nwill offer a unique stimulus to the muscles, which \\nwill encourage strength gains. In the programs, \\nweights are given in pounds; please see appendix \\nfor metric conversions.'),\n",

It signifies how much work you are actually \\ndoing. Therefore, manipulating the work in a work-\\nout is a logical way to alter workouts in an effort to \\nboost strength. This section covers three strength \\ntraining techniques that alter the sets during \\na workout. The first method incorporates sets \\nthat are completed only when the muscle is too \\nexhausted to complete another rep. The second \\nmethod involves using a set system that is based \\non time. The third method decreases the number \\nof sets it takes to complete a set number of reps.\\nFailure Training\\nAs defined in chapter 1, muscle failure is the point \\nduring an exercise at which the muscles have fully \\nfatigued and can no longer complete an additional \\nrep of that exercise using strict form. While body-\\nbuilders tend to complete all their sets to failure, \\npowerlifters rarely, if ever, train to muscle failure. \\nIn fact, the programs in chapter 8 are not meant \\nto be used with muscle failure. Each set is done \\nfor a certain number of reps with a certain amount \\nof weight. When the number of reps prescribed for \\nthat set are completed, the set is over. In most \\ncases, you will feel as though you could have com-\\npleted at least one more rep. This is how most \\npowerlifters train to increase muscle strength. \\nMany believe that training to muscle failure can \\nhinder strength gains. However, research from \\nAustralia suggests that training to muscle failure \\nmay enhance strength gains. The key appears to \\nbe the number of sets performed to failure—and \\nthat number appears to be one.\\nAustralian researchers discovered that when \\ntrained lifters completed one set to failure of the \\nfour sets they trained with on the bench press for \\neight weeks, they had double the strength gains \\nof lifters who did not complete any of the four sets \\nto failure. And in a follow-up study, they discovered \\nthat doing more than one set to failure on the \\nbench press for eight weeks offered no additional \\nincrease in strength gains. In fact, when comparing \\nthe two studies, the strength gains reported in \\nthe study using multiple sets to failure were less \\nimpressive than the strength gains reported in the \\nstudy using just one set to failure. The reason may \\nbe that performing only one set to failure allows \\nfor enough stimulus to be delivered to the muscle \\nfibers without fatiguing the muscle too much, which \\ncan limit muscle strength during the workout when \\ntraining with too many sets to failure.\\nTaking advantage of this knowledge is rather \\nsimple. Choose any basic strength training pro -\\ngram offered in chapter 8 and be sure to perform \\nthe last set, and only the last set, of every exercise \\n(except the abdominals) to muscle failure. See \\ntable 9.1 for a sample training program that takes \\nthe last set of each exercise to failure. One caveat \\nabout training to failure is safety. For obvious \\nreasons, it is not a method to be used by those \\nwho train alone, except when done with exercises \\nthat use machines or where it is easy to return \\nthe weight to a safe location—such as the dead-\\nlift, dumbbell bench press, Smith machine squat, \\nor barbell curl. Under no circumstances should \\nanyone training alone perform any barbell pressing \\nexercises, barbell squat, leg press, or hack squat \\nto failure or close to failure. These exercises all \\nrequire the help of an adequate spotter to ensure \\nthat the last rep is done accurately and safely.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5'),\n",

Instead of a set being defined \\nby the number of reps performed, a TUT set is \\ndefined by the length of time it takes to complete \\nthe set. The time it takes to complete the set is \\nreferred to as the time the muscle is under tension. \\nTension refers to the resistance from the weight \\nbeing used. The amount of time spent doing each \\nset for an exercise can be a critical component to \\nincreasing strength. Consider a set of five reps on \\nthe bench press. If the five reps each took about \\n2 seconds to lower the weight and another 2 sec-\\nonds to press the weight back up, that’s 4 seconds \\nper rep. Five reps at this pace would take a total \\nof about 20 seconds to complete the set. In other \\nwords, the TUT for that set would be 20 seconds. If \\nthe time to complete each of those five reps were \\nincreased to 6 seconds, the TUT of that set would \\nincrease to 30 seconds. Although the number of \\nreps and the amount of weight are the same on \\neach of these sets, the first set with a TUT of 20 \\nseconds is actually better for increasing strength.\\nJust as it is well established that muscle \\nstrength is best developed by training with a rep \\nrange of 1 to 6 per set, and muscle growth is \\nbest attained with a rep range of about 8 to 12, \\nsome strength training experts believe that the \\ntotal time a set takes to complete may be just \\nas important as the number of reps completed \\nper set.

Table 9.2 shows you the \\noptimal rep range and TUT for the desired muscle \\nadaptation. The last column lists the time per rep \\nrange to complete the set within the optimal TUT .\\nRegardless of the importance of TUT for muscle \\nadaptations, no one has suggested that TUT \\nranges should replace optimal rep ranges. Instead, \\ncombining both TUT and optimal rep ranges within \\na set may be a more precise way to prescribe how \\nmuch work should be placed on a muscle to induce \\nthe desired adaptations. Using the bench press as \\nan example, if five reps (which is within the optimal \\nrep range for strength gains) were performed at \\n4 seconds per rep, the entire set would take 20 \\nseconds to complete. That set would meet both \\nthe requirements for the optimal rep range and \\noptimal TUT range to stress a muscle for maximiz-\\ning strength gains.

This \\nallows for more variety in the training program while \\nstill staying on target for inducing strength gains.\\nTo train for maximal strength using TUT , keep \\nyour rep range at one to eight reps per set and the \\nTUT range at 4 to 20 seconds per set. Both the rep \\nrange and TUT range should change frequently, as \\nany good periodized program should.

To \\nstart, you choose a weight at which you can per -\\nform about 20 reps of the exercise of choice. The \\nfirst time you go through this, it will probably take \\nyou about six to eight sets, with two-minute rest \\nperiods between sets, to complete 70 repetitions. \\nYour goal is to eventually get the 70 total repeti -\\ntions done in four sets or fewer. The benefit of this \\nmethod is that it encourages strength changes and \\nmuscle growth by altering the biochemical path -\\nways in the muscle fibers. Over time, the muscles \\nare able to perform more reps per set because \\nthey are better at generating energy for muscle \\ncontractions. In addition, they are able to recover \\nmore fully between sets because of more efficient \\nbiochemical pathways. This method is great for \\ndeveloping endurance strength and therefore is \\nbest to use during periods in your strength training \\ncycle when reps are on the high end. See table \\n9.4 for a sample diminishing-set workout for the \\nbench press. A great way to use this method is to \\ndo this for two exercises per muscle group using \\nthis method for both exercises.

How strong a person is usually is measured \\nby the amount of weight he or she can lift for \\none rep. However, it’s rare to train for strength by \\ndoing single reps. Instead, a variety of rep ranges \\nare used to benefit the one-rep max. This section \\ncovers strength training programs that manipulate \\nthe repetitions that are performed during each set. \\nThis includes programs that alter the number of \\nreps performed per set (such as the 6 by 6 by 6 \\nsystem, 5 by 10 training, 16-week drop, 5–3–2 \\nmethod, and higher-strength program) as well as \\nprograms that manipulate the way each repetition \\nis performed (such as static strength training, \\nstronger by the inch program, ballistic training, and \\nnegative-rep training).\\n6 by 6 by 6 System\\nSimilar to the other numeral-driven programs, this \\none involves simply picking a weight that will allow \\nyou to perform six sets of six repetitions on an \\nexercise. The ideal weight will take you to failure \\nonly on the last set. Because of the higher volume \\nand intensity involved, muscle groups should not \\nbe trained more than twice per week. The benefit \\nof using this rep range is that it builds both a good \\ndeal of strength and muscle mass. The goal is to \\nincrease the weight used on each exercise by the \\nend of the six-week program. Increase the weight \\nwhen you can do more than six reps on the sixth \\nset.

The 5 portion of the program \\ncomes from the 5 by 5 training method, or five sets \\nof five reps with two-minute rest periods between \\nsets. It is a method for developing strength that \\ndates to the 1950s. The goal of the 5 by 5 workout \\nis to do five sets of five reps with a given weight. On \\nyour first workout you should pick a heavy weight \\nthat allows you to get only five reps on the first \\nset and possibly five on your second. This should \\nbe about 85 percent RM for most exercises. If \\nyou can get five reps on the third set, the weight \\nyou chose was too light; you’ll need to add 5 to \\n10 pounds depending on the exercise. If, on the \\nother hand, you can’t get at least 14 total reps over \\nthe five sets, the weight you chose was too heavy; \\nyou’ll need to drop about 5 to 10 pounds. When \\nyou find the right weight for the exercise, stay with \\nthat weight over the course of this workout until \\nyou can do all five sets for five reps. Then you’ll \\nstart over and increase the weight again to one \\nthat allows you to get only five reps on the first set. \\nDo this on two exercises for each muscle group \\n(for example, bench press and incline dumbbell \\nbench press, squat and leg press, and deadlift \\nand Romanian deadlift). For all other exercises \\nthat follow in that workout, do three sets of five \\nto seven reps (except for calf and ab exercises, \\nwhich can be done at higher reps).\\nThe 10 portion of the 5 by 10 program comes \\nfrom the 10 by 10 program used in this workout \\nscheme. The goal is to perform 10 sets of 10 reps \\nwith a given weight. The reason this is included \\nin a strength program is to stimulate the muscle \\nfibers with a different stimulus in each workout. \\nThe schemes of the 5 by 5 and the 10 by 10 are \\nsimilar, but different weights, reps, and total sets \\nare used for each. This cycling of weight, reps, \\nand sets prevents the muscle fibers from stag -\\nnating in the program, and therefore it enhances \\nmuscle adaptation.\\nFor the 10 by 10 training, do 10 sets of 10 reps \\nwith just one exercise per workout and follow it with \\nthree sets of 8 to 10 reps on all the subsequent \\nassistance exercises for that workout (except \\nfor calf and ab exercises, which can be done at \\nhigher reps). For the 10 by 10 training, choose a \\nweight that you can normally get for about 12 to \\n15 reps. This should be about 65 to 70 percent \\nRM for most exercises. The first few sets will feel \\nvery light. This will serve as a thorough warm-up. \\nPerform these early sets with explosive power on \\neach rep to recruit more of the fast-twitch muscle \\nfibers that are capable of greater gains in strength \\nand power. As the sets continue, the fatigue will \\nstart to set in and the number of reps will fall \\ndrastically. As with the 5 by 5 program, once you \\ncan complete 10 sets of 10 reps, you increase the \\nweight again and start over.\\nBecause you will reach failure several times on \\neach workout, you should train each muscle group \\nonly once per week, such as with the squat–bench \\npress–deadlift training split. This split is used in \\nthe sample 5 by 10 program outline in table 9.6. \\nSimply follow this split and alternate the weight, \\nreps, and sets every other week. You’ll likely reach \\nthe 5 by 5 goal first. Increase the weight again and \\ncontinue progressing until you reach the 10 by 10 \\ngoal or eight weeks have passed. Then switch over \\nto a more basic training scheme.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\n5 by 10 Training'),\n",

The 16-week drop \\nis a great program for beginner and intermediate \\nweightlifters who are interested in peaking maximal \\nstrength. Because it starts with lighter weight and \\nhigher reps and slowly increases the weight while \\ndecreasing the reps over the 16 weeks, it allows \\nthe beginner enough time to work with higher \\nreps and lower intensities before jumping into the \\nheavy-weight and low-rep training that is required \\nto boost maximal strength. It works well with any \\ntraining split, including a whole-body strength \\ntraining split. This program starts with sets of 12 \\nreps with a weight that is about 70 percent RM \\nfor three weeks. Then the reps drop to 10 per set \\nwith a weight increase to about 75 percent RM \\nfor the next three weeks. Next the weight bumps \\nup to 80 percent RM and the reps drop to 8 per \\nset for the next three weeks. Following that, the \\nweight increases again to 85 percent RM and reps \\ndrop to five per set for the next three weeks.

They studied leg strength in subjects on a \\n10-week program of leg presses and leg exten -\\nsions. One group trained with five sets of three \\nto five reps while the second group added one \\nset of 25 to 30 reps at the end of each exercise. \\nThe group that added the 25 to 30 reps had a 5 \\npercent greater increase in strength, as well as \\ngreater increases in muscle size, than the group \\nperforming just five sets of 3 to 5 reps. Although \\nthe scientists were unsure of the exact mecha -\\nnism for the additional strength gains, it appears \\nthat the single set of higher reps provides an \\nadditional training stimulus that affects strength \\ngains. The higher levels of growth hormone \\nassociated with the higher-rep training may have \\naffected adaptations in muscle fibers that could \\nhave increased the strength of the muscle fibers. \\nTaking advantage of this information is as simple \\nas adding one set of 25 to 30 reps with a weight \\nthat is only about 45 to 50 percent RM to a pro -\\ngram that incorporates a 5 by 5 strength training \\nsystem. Be sure to take this final set to muscle \\nfailure. Since this program is fairly demanding on \\nthe muscle fibers, you should train each muscle \\ngroup just once per week while using this program \\nin table 9.9. Follow it for no more than eight weeks.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 9.8 5–3–2 Strength Program (continued)\\n1Thursday perform bench press and incline dumbbell press before \\nsquat.\\n2Thursday perform seated calf raise.\\n3Friday perform hanging leg raise.\\n4Friday perform Russian twist.\\n5Friday perform dumbbell woodchopper.'),\n",

Although using a full range of motion \\n(ROM) is typically a smart thing to do, there are \\noccasions when going against the norm is war -\\nranted, such as when strength gains have come to \\na halt regardless of the programs you have tried. \\nWhen this is the case, it’s time to pull out all the \\nstops and use something quite unorthodox—such \\nas static strength training. The term \\nstatic means \\nlack of movement, as in an isometric contraction. \\nAnd as this term implies, with static training you \\ntake a weight and hold it in a fixed position for \\nseveral seconds. This concept is based on the idea \\nthat by forcing the muscle to work only when it is \\nmaximally contracted and using the heaviest weight \\npossible, you can optimize its strength potential.\\nAlthough there is no published research to sup-\\nport its effectiveness, anecdotal reports on static \\nstrength training are quite impressive. In fact, Bob \\nHoffman, founder of the York Barbell Company \\nand former U.S. Olympic weightlifting coach, had \\nmembers of the U.S. team use a similar training \\nsystem with much success in the early 1960s. The \\nlate Mike Mentzer, professional bodybuilder, also \\ntouted the effectiveness of static contractions for \\nbuilding both muscle size and strength. It appears \\nto work because of the overload that is placed on \\nthe muscle. When you train using a full ROM, the \\namount of weight you can use is limited by your \\nsticking point—the point in the exercise ROM where \\nyou’re weakest. You can use only as much weight as \\nyou can lift through that sticking point. With static \\ncontractions, the sticking point is eliminated, so \\nyou can overload the muscle fibers with as much \\nweight as you can hold for at least 10 seconds in \\nthe strongest position of the particular muscle.\\nTo use static strength training properly, be sure \\nto start each workout with a thorough warm-up. \\nDo two light sets of each exercise you’re training \\nstatically. On each rep, stop and hold for a count \\nof three at about two to four inches from the end \\nof the full contraction. Hit a third warm-up set with \\na weight you can do for about six reps, but do only \\nTABLE 9.9 Get High for Strength'),\n",

Do two static sets per exer-\\ncise with two minutes of rest in between sets. The \\nweight you choose should be light enough to allow \\nyou to hold it statically at about two to four inches \\nfrom the full contraction point of the movement for \\nat least 10 seconds but heavy enough so that you \\ncan’t hold it for more than 20 seconds. See the \\nfollowing sample photos of static contraction hold \\npositions for common exercises. Once you can hold \\na weight for more than 20 seconds, it’s time to \\nincrease the weight. After the second set, drop the \\nweight and do three full-ROM sets of that exercise.\\nYou’ll need a reliable training partner to help you \\nwith this training method. Your training partner will \\nneed to help you move the weight to the static posi-\\ntion but should apply only enough force as needed \\nto help you get the weight there. That will help to \\nprepare your muscles to resist the weight during the \\nstatic contraction. The training partner should also \\nwatch the clock during your static sets to make sure \\nyou are within the time window of 10 to 20 seconds \\nper set. A Smith machine makes a good tool to use \\nfor many of the static contraction exercises because \\nit is easier to set the weight in the correct position.\\nTry the static strength training program outlined \\nin table 9.10 for eight weeks before returning to \\nfull-ROM training. The goal is to progress to heavier \\nweights for the static contraction sets over the \\neight weeks. This should carry over to greater \\nstrength when you return to full-ROM training.

It is a method \\nto use sparingly, such as when all other strength \\ntraining methods have failed to provide sufficient \\ngains in strength.

This allows you to accurately measure the ROM \\nand keep it limited to where you want it. The pins \\nwill also act as a safety net for when you fail. See \\nthe Rack It Up box for setting up properly in the rack.\\nYou start the program with about 10 percent \\nmore weight than your current one-rep max (1RM) \\nfor the lift on which you wish to increase your \\nstrength.

This is because each \\nstrength exercise has a natural biomechanical \\nsticking point that occurs at a spot in the range of \\nmotion where primary muscle groups are changing. \\nFor example, in the bench press, the sticking point \\nfor many lifters is where the primary force is being \\nchanged from the pectoralis major to the deltoids \\nand triceps. Ballistic training uses explosive move-\\nments that power you through these sticking points.\\nThe major benefit of ballistic training has to \\ndo with acceleration. In a traditional rep, you \\ntypically accelerate the weight on the concentric \\nportion only during the first third of the range of \\nmotion. During the other two-thirds, the weight is \\nactually being decelerated. If deceleration did not \\ntake place, you wouldn’t be able to hold onto the \\nweight at the end of the rep. Yet, when you train \\nballistically, the weight is accelerated through the \\nwhole range of motion and starts to decelerate \\nonly after you’ve let go of the bar. This allows you \\nto develop much more power through the rep.\\nBallistic training also forces your body to trig -\\nger fast-twitch muscle fibers. This is important \\nbecause these fibers have the greatest potential \\nfor strength gains. Because ballistic training forces \\nthe muscles to adapt to contracting very quickly \\nand forcefully, it trains the fast-twitch fibers to \\nproduce a great amount of force in a very short \\nperiod. This is very useful when applying a great \\namount of force such as during a max bench press, \\nsquat, or deadlift.\\nBallistic training is most commonly performed \\nwith bench press throws and squat jumps, often \\nusing a Smith machine, which guides the bar \\nsecurely along metal rods. Yet, ballistic training is \\nnot confined to these exercises. In fact, ballistic \\ntraining can be done for almost any muscle group. \\nSee table 9.13 for a list of ballistic exercises that \\ncan be performed in any gym.\\nRegardless of the exercise, ballistic training \\nshould be done with a weight that is about 30 to 50 \\npercent of the 1RM for that exercise. This weight \\nis used because research has shown that opti -\\nmal power is produced at about 30 to 50 percent \\nRM. For example, if your max bench press is 300 \\npounds, you would do bench press throws on the \\nSmith machine with about 90 to 150 pounds. The \\nnumber of reps performed with ballistic training is \\nthree to five reps, never any more. This is to keep \\nevery rep a max effort and prevent fatigue. Fatigue \\ndoes not benefit the development of power and can \\nactually increase the risk of injury when training \\nballistically. Therefore, rest time should be ample \\nbetween sets. Take at least three minutes of rest \\nbefore doing another set.\\nA great way to work ballistic training into your \\nregimen is to use a max effort–dynamic effort train-\\ning split and perform the ballistic training during \\nthe dynamic effort portion of the split. An example \\nof this is outlined in table 9.14 to be done on the \\nthird and fourth workouts (usually on Thursday \\nand Friday) of a max effort–dynamic effort training \\nsplit. Another way to train ballistically is to follow a \\nsquat, bench press, and deadlift training split on \\na full-body ballistic workout performed on a fourth \\nday.

Unlike negative-rep training to build muscle \\nmass, negative-rep strength training does not \\ncome as an afterthought at the end of a workout \\nbut as the first and foremost method used in the \\nworkout. Doing negative reps as the first sets of an \\nexercise allows for greater than 100 percent RM \\nto be used as weight. Most lifters can resist about \\n130 percent of their 1RM on the negative portion \\nof the rep. Training with this much weight even on \\nthe negative motion of an exercise can cause real \\nstrength gains on the positive portion of the exer-\\ncise as well. This has to do with muscle fiber and \\nnerve adaptations. The overload that the excess \\nweight places on the muscle fiber induces muscle \\ndamage and influences the nerves that cause the \\nmuscles to recruit more fast-twitch muscle fibers. \\nThese two factors result in muscle regeneration that \\nleads to larger and stronger muscle fibers as well \\nas a greater number of fast-twitch muscle fibers.\\nWhen training with negative reps, the key is \\nto perform the rep slowly. You should attempt a \\nweight that is about 130 percent of your 1RM for \\nthe exercises you are training and resist it at a rate \\nthat takes three to five seconds to complete the \\nnegative rep. If you can resist the weight for longer \\nthan five seconds, add more weight. If you can’t \\nresist the weight for at least three seconds, reduce \\nthe weight. Perform three sets of four to six nega-\\ntive reps for each major lift—bench press, squats \\n(should be done on Smith machine), and deadlift. \\nFollow the negatives with two sets of regular reps \\nusing a weight that is about 75 to 80 percent RM.\\nBecause of the intensity of negative-rep training, \\nyou’ll need more time to recover between sets, \\nat least three minutes. The same holds true for \\nrecovery between workouts, because you should \\nallow a full seven days of rest between workouts. \\nThat makes the squat–bench press–deadlift train-\\ning split a popular one to use when training with \\nnegative-rep training. See table 9.16 for a sample \\nnegative-rep training week using that split. Follow \\nthis for no more than six weeks.\\nTo use negative-rep training safely and effec -\\ntively, you should have the help of a training \\npartner. Those who train alone can do unilateral \\nnegatives with the help of a Smith machine. To do \\nthis, load the Smith machine with about 70 percent \\nRM for the bench press, squat, or deadlift.

This refers to the ability of one \\nexercise to immediately enhance the performance \\nof a second exercise that is performed shortly after \\nthe first exercise. Although there are many ways to \\ndo this, the max-out for muscle strength method \\nuses the same exercise but different weights \\nto achieve the same effect. More precisely, this \\nmethod uses a one-rep set with 90 percent RM to \\nenhance the number of reps that can be performed \\nwith a subsequent set using 80 percent RM.\\nAlthough the exact mechanism for this phenom-\\nenon has not been pinpointed, scientists currently \\nbelieve that it may be due to enhanced excitation of \\nthe central nervous system or to molecular events \\nin the muscle fibers themselves. In simpler terms, \\nperforming the heavy set “tricks” your nervous \\nsystem into preparing for another heavy set. When \\nyou suddenly drop the weight, it feels lighter than \\nit normally would because your nervous system is \\ncalling in more muscle fibers to do the job than it \\nnormally would for the lighter weight. This is the \\nreason baseball players swing with a weighted bat \\nbefore hitting with a much lighter bat. Regardless \\nof the mechanism, the bottom line is that it may \\nincrease your strength on lighter sets by close to \\n10 percent.\\nTo perform this method in the gym, you do one \\nset using 90 to 95 percent RM for just one rep. \\nThen you rest three minutes and perform a set \\nwith about 10 percent more than 80 percent RM \\n(a weight you can normally lift for about eight reps). \\nThe potentiation from the previous set should \\nallow you to complete about eight reps with the \\nheavier weight. For example, if your 1RM on the \\nbench press is 300, the first set you do (after two \\nor three warm-up sets) is for one rep with about \\n275 to 285 pounds. The second set you do would \\nbe with 260 pounds for about eight reps. Normally \\nyou would be able to lift only 240 pounds for eight \\nreps, but the potentiation increased your strength \\nby roughly 10 percent.\\nThe best way to use this technique is to reserve \\nit for major lifts and train those lifts just once per \\nweek. Do not use the max-out for muscle strength \\ntechnique for more than eight weeks consecutively \\nfor any exercise. See table 9.17 for a sample squat \\nworkout using the max-out for muscle strength \\ntechnique. This workout is for a lifter whose 1RM \\non the squat is 365 pounds, whose 90% RM is \\nabout 330 pounds, and whose 80% RM (what he or \\nshe can normally complete for eight reps) is about \\n290 pounds.

Basically, in each \\nworkout the weight lifted is increased by about \\n5 percent and the number of reps performed is \\ndecreased by one. Although the 5 percent program \\nis a little more complicated than that, the result is \\nsimply an increase in strength of about 10 percent \\nafter only six successive workouts. The 5 percent \\nprogram is best used on basic exercises such \\nas the bench press, incline bench press, squat, \\ndeadlift, leg press, shoulder press, barbell row, \\nand pulldown. It can also be adapted to basic arm \\nexercises such as close-grip bench press, triceps \\npressdown, triceps extension, and the barbell curl. \\nPerform no more than three exercises per muscle \\ngroup and provide each with five to seven days of \\nrest between workouts. To start the 5 percent pro-\\ngram, pick a weight for each exercise that allows \\nyou to perform four sets of six reps with three- to \\nfour-minute rest periods between sets. We’ll use \\nthe squat, with a weight of 300 pounds, as an \\nexample. In workout 1 you would perform four sets \\nof the squat, each for six reps using 300 pounds. \\nFor workout 2 you increase the weight by 5 per -\\ncent—or to 315 pounds—and finish four sets of \\nfive reps. At workout 3 you increase the weight by \\n5 percent again (from the original 300 pounds)—or \\n330 pounds—and do four sets of four reps. Work-\\nout 4 has a slight change. Here you drop 5 percent \\nof the weight from the previous workout—back to \\n315 pounds—but you do four sets of six reps. \\nAt workout 5 you bump up the weight again by 5 \\npercent to 330 pounds and do four sets of five \\nreps. In workout six you increase the weight again \\nby 5 percent—or 345 pounds—and do four sets \\nof four reps.

This is due \\nto the small progressions in weight that take place \\nwith each wave. The waves actually allow you to \\nlift up to 102 percent of your current max right off \\nthe bat. While that may equate to only a few extra \\npounds, over six to eight weeks the total expected \\nstrength boost is somewhere around 10 percent.\\nFor this program, you’ll perform a few warm-up \\nsets, then two or three waves of three sets each, \\nwith four minutes of rest between waves and \\nbetween each set. During wave 1, your first set \\nwill consist of three reps with 90 percent RM (a \\nweight you can normally lift for about four reps). \\nSet 2 consists of two reps with 95 percent RM. \\nAnd on set 3, you’ll do one rep with 100 percent \\nRM. On wave 2 you’ll increase the weight used \\non each set by about 1 percent. In other words, \\nset 1 will be about 91 percent RM, set 2 will be \\n96 percent RM, and set 3 will be 101 percent \\nRM. Because this increment is so small and the \\nsmallest Olympic plates are 1.25 pounds, this \\nwill equal a 2.5-pound jump on any weight under \\n400 pounds. For weights of 400 pounds or more, \\nadd 5 pounds. In either case, on the third set of \\nwave 2, you’ll be lifting more than your current \\nmax. If you’re up for it, go for a third wave. To do \\nso, simply increase the weight another 1 percent \\nfor each set and go for the same number of reps \\non each set. That means 102 percent of your max \\non that third set.\\nThe goal of wave training is to increase the \\nweight used on each wave by 1 to 2 percent every \\nworkout. Bit by bit, you can notch up your overall \\nstrength. But if you aren’t successful completing \\nthe last set of the last wave of a workout, start \\nthe next workout with the same weights you used \\nthe previous time and really push to break through \\non this round. Then you can raise the weight on \\nthe next workout.\\nThe reason wave training works has to do with \\npotentiation—similar to the potentiation discussed \\nin the max-out for muscle strength method. The \\nearlier sets prime the nervous system, or the con-\\ntractile fibers of the muscle, in such a way that the \\nmuscle is able to contract with more force on later \\nsets. As most of the strength techniques suggest, \\nreserve this strength training method for the prime \\nstrength movements or the exercises you substi-\\ntute for them. Follow the wave training with three \\nsets of four to six reps on assistance exercises.\\nBecause of the high intensity of this program, \\nyou shouldn’t train each major lift or muscle group \\nmore than once per week. Therefore, the squat–\\nbench press–deadlift training split is ideal to use \\nwith wave training. See table 9.20 for a sample \\nwave training deadlift program, set up for a person \\nwho can currently deadlift 405 pounds for one rep \\nand wants to get up to 445 pounds.

Most lifters rest a full three \\nminutes between sets and rarely veer from this \\nstandard. However, altering rest periods can have a \\nsignificant impact on strength gains when properly \\nexecuted. This section covers strength training \\nprograms that systematically alter the rest peri -\\nods involved. This can be done by implementing \\nshort rest periods between each rep (as with the \\nrest–pause technique), by progressively lowering \\nthe rest between sets every week (as with one-rep \\nto one-set method), or by progressively losing rest \\ntime between sets because of an increase in the \\nnumber of reps performed each week (as found \\nin the density training technique).\\nRest–Pause Technique\\nRest–pause is a lifting technique that involves \\nstopping during a set, resting for a short period, \\nand then continuing with the set. Its major advan-\\ntage is that it allows for more total reps to be \\ndone with a given weight. That’s because it takes \\nadvantage of the muscles’ ability to recover rap -\\nidly. In simple terms, it allows the muscles time \\nto replenish phosphocreatine (PCr)—the same \\nmolecule that creatine supplements boost. With \\nthis shot of extra energy, the muscle can contract \\nmore strongly, producing greater force and getting \\nmore reps. The greater the force your muscle can \\nproduce and the more reps you can perform, the \\ngreater the stimulus the muscles receive and the \\ngreater the gains in strength that you can expect.\\nThe concept behind rest–pause training for \\nstrength gains is not necessarily to get more \\ntotal reps or reach a higher state of fatigue but to \\noptimize the force produced on each rep. To prior-\\nitize strength gains with rest–pause, you typically \\nuse a weight that allows you to get only three to \\nfive reps (3- to 5RM). The most common form of \\nrest–pause training is to choose a weight that you \\ncan perform at only about three reps. Do one rep \\nand rack the weight. Rest 15 seconds and then \\npump out another rep. Repeat this process until \\nyou have completed three to five reps total. That \\nconcludes one rest–pause set. This technique has \\nbeen shown to be effective at producing decent \\nstrength gains, but it may not be the most effective.\\nIn the laboratory it was discovered that an even \\nbetter rest–pause technique for building strength \\ninvolved shorter rest periods—about 3 to 5 sec -\\nonds. Instead of racking the weight and resting 15 \\nseconds between each rep, you simply hold the \\nweight and rest for 3 to 5 seconds then complete \\nanother rep. Do this for a total of three reps. Stop-\\nping at three reps allows you to do three sets at \\nthe same weight, which maximizes the stimulus \\nthe muscle receives. Rest–pause training can work \\nwith any training split. To get appreciable results \\nfrom rest–pause training, you will need to use it \\nconsistently for four to six weeks.\\nTable 9.22 gives a sample bench press routine. \\nDo all three sets using this rest–pause technique \\nand then follow them up with a second exercise \\nfor chest (such as incline bench press or dumbbell \\nbench press) for another three sets of rest–pause. \\nYou will find that you can use considerably more \\nweight than usual on the second exercise because \\nyou will not be as fatigued as you would be with \\nthree regular sets.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 9.22 A Pause for Strength\\nExercise Weight Set Reps Rest Comments\\nBench press 260 1, 2, 3 1, 1, 1 3 min Do 3 reps total, each separated by 5 seconds of rest in \\ntop position.'),\n",

Doing 10 \\nsets of one rep with the same weight each set is \\nthe same amount of work as one set of 10 reps \\nwith that same weight. The difference is that doing \\nthe work as a single set is harder because of the \\nfatigue that sets in—partly from the increasing \\nlevels of lactic acid. If you slowly, over time, reduce \\nthe amount of rest between those 10 sets, you \\nwill train the muscle to be better at producing the \\nquick energy you need and to deal with the lactic \\nacid—and this obviously will help the muscles grow \\nstronger. The best way to go about this is to start \\nwith a weight at which you can do 10 sets of one \\nrep with 90-second rest periods between sets. You \\nthen attempt to shave 15 seconds off of the rest \\nperiods with each successive workout.\\nHow this works is simple: Consider that you \\ncan lift the weight for 10 reps—just not 10 reps \\nin a row.

This is partic-\\nularly good for increasing strength on body-weight \\nexercises, such as pull-ups, dips, and push-ups \\n(since you can’t change your body weight easily), \\nbut it can be used for any exercise. Density training \\nbegins by doubling the volume of work you want \\nto accomplish. If your goal is to complete 12 reps \\nwith a certain amount of weight, then you start off \\nwith 12 sets of 2 reps (or 24 total reps) in 12 min-\\nutes. So rest is about 50 seconds between sets. \\nBasically you have 1 minute to complete each set \\nand rest before the next set. The more reps you \\ndo each set, the less rest you are allowed. After \\nthis becomes easy, move to 8 sets of 3 reps in 8 \\nminutes. When this becomes easy, move to 6 sets \\nof 4 reps in 6 minutes, then 5 sets of 5 reps in 5 \\nminutes, then 4 sets of 6 reps in 4 minutes. When \\nthis becomes easy, move to 3 sets of 8 reps in 3 \\nminutes. When you’ve mastered this, you should \\nbe able to get 1 set of 12 straight reps. By per -\\nforming the same overall amount of work (24 reps) \\nand progressively decreasing the amount of rest \\ntime, you are increasing the amount of work done \\nduring a given amount of time or increasing the \\ndensity of the work.

Allow yourself \\nto repeat the same workout only twice.\\nPROGRAMS THAT MANIPULATE \\nEXERCISE SELECTION\\nThere are countless exercises that you can use \\nto enhance muscle strength. Using the proper \\nexercises can make a huge difference in your \\nstrength gains. This section discusses strength \\ntraining methods that alter the exercises that are \\nused to increase muscle strength. Some of these \\ntechniques focus solely on specific types of exer-\\ncises, such as unilateral training and the dumbbell \\npower program, while others use specific types of \\nexercises in a particular order, such as the three-\\nstep strength method, front-to-back training, and \\nECO training method.\\nUnilateral Training\\nUnilateral training refers to training one side of the \\nbody at a time. Unlike one-sided training for build-\\ning muscle mass (covered in chapter 6), unilateral \\ntraining does not separate training days into left- \\nand right-side workouts. Unilateral training simply \\nuses exercises that are performed with one limb \\nat a time—such as the one-arm dumbbell bench \\npress, the one-leg squat, and even the one-leg, \\none-arm dumbbell deadlift. Although this approach \\nto training is nothing revolutionary, few power -\\nlifters actually train using unilateral exercises. \\nThis is unfortunate, since research confirms that \\nwhen you train unilaterally the muscles are able \\nto produce more force, and more muscle fibers \\n(particularly fast-twitch muscle fibers) are active. \\nOne study comparing unilateral biceps curls to \\nbilateral (both arms) biceps curls reported that the \\nforce produced on bilateral biceps curls was up to \\nabout 20 percent less than the sum of the force \\nproduced from the left- and right-arm unilateral \\ncurls. In other words, if you could curl 100 pounds \\nwith a barbell for one rep, you would expect to be \\nable to curl only a 50-pound dumbbell with each \\narm for one rep. In reality, you may be able to curl \\na 60-pound dumbbell with each arm for one rep. \\nAdding the weight of those dumbbells together \\nwould mean that you could curl a total of 120 \\npounds, or 20 percent more than with both arms \\nat the same time.\\nTo take advantage of the added strength that \\nunilateral training offers, you should periodically do \\none-arm and one-leg exercises. See table 9.25 for \\na list of one-arm and one-leg exercises that can be \\nadded to a strength training program. Descriptions \\nof how to perform these exercises correctly are \\nfound in part V . A great way to incorporate these \\nexercises into your current strength training pro -\\ngram is to include two sets of unilateral versions \\nof the strength lifts after you have completed the \\nworking sets of the strength lifts.

While \\none benefit of this training method is the variety of \\nexercises, the main benefit stems from the order \\nin which you do these exercises. The major reason \\nfor this has to do with the stabilizer muscles.\\nThe stabilizer muscles generally lie deep under \\nyour major muscle groups (the prime movers). \\nThough the stabilizers are often much smaller and \\nweaker, they’re important for securing the joints \\nduring various movements. When you train with \\nequipment that’s fairly unstable—such as dumb-\\nbells—the stabilizer muscles become fatigued \\nmuch sooner than the muscle group you’re trying \\nto work because the stabilizers are weaker. When \\nthe stabilizers are fatigued, the brain limits the \\nnervous input to the prime movers in order to \\nprevent injury from occurring. In other words, the \\nstabilizers limit the amount of force the prime \\nmovers can produce.\\nOne unorthodox way to train that prevents the \\nstabilizers from being the weak link in your training \\nis to order your exercises in a manner that moves \\nfrom the least stable exercise to the most stable. \\nThis way, as the stabilizer muscles fatigue, you \\nchange the exercises to ones that require less \\nactivity of the stabilizers. This allows the prime \\nmovers to train with heavy weights that are not \\nlimited by the fatigue of the stabilizer muscles. \\nThe three-step strength method follows this order \\nby starting the workout with dumbbell exercises, \\nwhich require the most help from the stabilizers \\nbecause each arm is allowed to move in all direc-\\ntions that the joints will allow. For leg exercises, \\none-leg exercises would take the place of dumbbell \\nexercises. The workout then moves to a barbell \\nexercise. Because it is a free-weight exercise, you \\nstill require some use of stabilizer muscles. But \\nbecause these exercises are done bilaterally with \\nboth arms locked in place on the bar (upper-body \\nexercises) or both legs locked in place on the floor \\n(leg exercises), there is less use of the stabilizers \\nthan with dumbbell or unilateral leg exercises. \\nThe last type of exercise on the list is a machine \\nexercise. This type of exercise requires barely any \\nhelp from the stabilizers because the movement \\nof the machine forces your body to follow a prede-\\ntermined path that doesn’t permit deviation. Since \\nthe machine is designed to target particular prime \\nmovers, the stabilizers are basically not needed.\\nAs an example of a three-step strength method \\nworkout for a bench press-focused workout, you \\nwould start with the dumbbell bench press, then \\nmove to the barbell bench press, and finish with \\nthe machine bench press. For a squat-focused \\nworkout, you could start with the one-leg squat as \\nthe first exercise, then move to the barbell squat as \\nthe second exercise, and finish with the leg press. \\nUsing this training method for a deadlift-focused \\nworkout is not ideal but can be done. For this \\nworkout, start with the one-leg, one-arm dumbbell \\ndeadlift, then move to the standard deadlift, and \\nfinish with a horizontal leg press machine (but \\nstart the movement from the down position, which \\nmimics the deadlift).\\nThis training method should not take the place \\nof standard strength training methods that orga -\\nnize the major strength exercises first in the work-\\nout. Instead, the best way to use the three-step \\nstrength method is to train with it on a second \\nworkout for that lift later in the week. For instance, \\nyou can do a standard bench press workout early in \\nthe week and then do a three-step strength method \\nbench press workout later in the week. This works \\nwell with the squat–bench press–deadlift training \\nsplit by adding a three-step strength method work-\\nout on Saturday. An example of this is shown in \\nthe workout in table 9.27. Each exercise should \\nbe done for 3 working sets. The amount of weight \\nused and the reps performed can be cycled to \\ncorrespond with your training phase.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nThree-Step Strength Method'),\n",

Training this way is not \\nany more beneficial than using barbells, but it can \\nwork to pull you out of a training slump and get your \\nstrength gains climbing again for several reasons. \\nThe first reason is the change. Changing your train-\\ning with different exercises, such as those found \\nin the dumbbell power program, can affect your \\noverall strength by recruiting different muscle fibers \\nthat you may have neglected from doing the usual \\nexercises in your routine. Then there’s the strength \\nimbalance that most lifters have. Some experience \\nup to a 10 percent difference between their stron-\\nger side and weaker side. Unilateral training with \\ndumbbells forces the weaker side to gain strength \\nsince that side must lift the dumbbell on its own.\\nAnother benefit of dumbbells is that they can \\nimprove the strength of your stabilizer muscles. \\nThis can actually enhance overall muscle strength \\nwhile reducing the risk of injury to your joints. \\nDumbbell strength training is also great for those \\nwho train at home. Dumbbells take up little room, \\nand you can perform a variety of exercises in a \\nminimal amount of space. These exercises are \\nalso great for those with shoulder, elbow, or wrist \\ninjuries because they allow a freer ROM compared \\nto the ROM allowed with barbells.\\nThe dumbbell power program is a six-week \\nprogram that involves many multijoint and \\nmultimovement exercises that increase overall \\nbody strength. See table 9.28 for the outline of \\nthe program. Detailed descriptions on how to \\nperform these exercises can be found in part V . \\nEach workout is done three days per week—usually \\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday. If you want, you \\ncan include one extra training day that hits the \\nsquat, bench press, and deadlift. In weeks 1 and \\n2, you’ll train with three sets of 10 to 12 reps with \\n90 seconds of rest between sets. During weeks \\n3 and 4, the weight increases and the reps drop \\nto six to eight per set. Increase the rest to two \\nminutes between sets. For the final two weeks \\n(weeks 5 and 6), you increase the weight again \\nand drop the reps to four to six per set. Increase \\nthe rest periods again to three minutes between \\nsets to allow ample recovery time. The abdominal \\nand core exercises, however, increase in reps. For \\nthese, the weight should stay the same or even \\nincrease over the six weeks, and rest should be \\nconstant at one minute between sets.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 9.27 Three-Stepping for Strength'),\n",

On the Thursday upper-\\nbody workout, you should switch the order of the \\nexercise pair on all exercises except the bench \\npress. The Tuesday lower-body workout focuses \\non the squat, and the Friday lower-body workout \\nfocuses on the deadlift. You will do five sets of \\neach exercise pair. The first exercise should be \\ndone for no more than five reps with a weight that \\nis about 50 to 70 percent RM (a weight that allows \\nyou to complete about 12 to 20 reps) for that \\nexercise. The key is doing these reps explosively \\nand not fatiguing the muscles. Rest no more than \\n60 seconds between exercises and do four to six \\nreps on the second exercise. Normally that would \\nbe a weight that is about 85 to 90 percent RM. \\nHowever, the additional strength you get from the \\nantagonist exercise may allow you to complete \\nfour to six reps with up to 95 percent RM.

With this method, you \\ntrain exercises that are opposing movements and \\ntrain opposing muscle groups back to back. That \\nis, you do one set of the first exercise and follow \\nit with one set of an exercise that is the opposite \\nmovement of that first exercise. This is similar to \\nsuperset training with a longer rest period allowed \\nbetween the opposing exercises. For example, \\nduring front-to-back training you will train the bench \\npress and barbell row together.\\nThe advantage of training opposing muscle \\ngroups back to back is that you’ll be stronger in \\nthe second exercise. Research has found that a \\nmuscle will be stronger if preceded immediately \\nby a contraction of its antagonist, or opposing \\nmuscle group. For example, when you do a super-\\nset of barbell row and bench press in that order, \\nyou’ll be stronger on the bench press—as long as \\nyou don’t train to failure on the row. The reason \\nfor this phenomenon is that, to some degree, the \\nagonist muscle is limited by its antagonist. When \\nbench-pressing using straight sets, for example, \\nthe back muscles inhibit the contraction of the \\npectoral muscles to a certain extent. Doing a set \\nof rows shortly before benching, however, lessens \\nthis inhibitory effect, allowing your pecs to contract \\nmore forcefully.\\nThe front-to-back training routine presented in \\ntable 9.29 uses an upper- and lower-body training \\nsplit for a total of four workouts per week.

There are only \\ntwo programs covered here because few lifters \\ninterested in training for strength view training \\nfrequency as an important variable to cycle in \\nan effort to increase muscle strength. However, \\nchanging the frequency of your training can have \\na dramatic effect on gains in muscle strength. The \\noverreaching method and the up-and-down strength \\nmethod are two programs that are effective at \\nenhancing strength by manipulating the frequency \\nof training.\\nOverreaching Method\\nThis program actually causes you to overtrain in \\nan effort to increase strength. The program design \\nis based on research investigating overtraining \\nin athletes. But the concept is not all that new. \\nIt originated from training principles from the \\nEastern Bloc countries. Overreaching is basically \\novertraining without suffering from the negative \\neffects of overtraining. The trick is backing off at \\nthe right time. The difference between overtraining \\nand overreaching is mainly time. Overtraining is a \\nmore chronic situation. It’s not something that can \\njust happen in a couple of days; it may take two \\nto four weeks of training too heavily or too long \\nto become truly overtrained. By then hormonal \\nperturbations usually have surfaced and so will \\nthe classic signs: fatigue, loss of appetite, lack of \\nstrength, muscle loss, insomnia, and depression.\\nOverreaching is similar to overtraining in that \\nthe training is the same. The difference is that \\noverreaching is for a short period and ends before \\nthe catastrophic changes in your body’s physiology \\nhave taken place. In other words, overreaching \\nis overtraining before the overtrained state is \\nreached. For four weeks you will train all muscle \\ngroups five days per week. See table 9.31 for the \\noutline of the overreaching training split. You will \\ndo three sets per exercise; each week the weight \\nincreases and the reps decrease. The exception is \\nthe Friday workout, where you train using maximal \\neffort (up to 100 percent RM) on the squat, bench \\npress, and deadlift. At the end of the four weeks, \\nyou back off on the training frequency as well as \\nthe weight and slow it down to training each muscle \\ngroup just once per week with a squat–bench \\npress–deadlift training split.

This chapter \\nis designed to help you take the information you \\nhave learned from chapter 8 (basic program design \\nfor training programs that build maximal strength) \\nand chapter 9 (advanced training techniques) and \\nput it together to build a long-term training program \\nthat works to continually build strength.\\nThis chapter starts by teaching you how to test \\nyour 1RM. Regardless of your training level, you \\nneed to assess your strength level accurately for \\nbest results from your training. The first training \\nprogram offered in this chapter is a beginner \\nprogram. If you have little experience in strength \\ntraining, this program will enable you to take on \\nthe basic strength programs that are most effec-\\ntive for gaining strength. Once you have followed \\na strength training program consistently for at \\nleast six months, you are ready to take on an \\neffective program based on the splits discussed \\nin chapter 8. If you are at the intermediate level, \\nthese programs use the percentage method of \\ntraining. This is a training system that gradually \\nincreases the weight used by a percentage of \\nthe 1RM.\\nAdvanced lifters, those with over a year of \\nstrength training experience, can begin using the \\nmethods and techniques covered in chapter 9. One \\ncycle found in the following section is an advanced \\nprogram that alters these techniques throughout \\nthe different phases. Finally, if you are interested \\nin increasing your strength in one lift, you can refer \\nto the sections that focus on just one lift.\\nTESTING ONE-REPETITION \\nMAXIMUM\\nRegardless of where they are starting from, all lift-\\ners interested in training to build maximal strength \\nhave one goal in common—more strength! With the \\nexception of powerlifters, who commonly test their \\n1RM strength in competition, most lifters do not \\nroutinely test their strength by maxing out. \\nMaxing \\nout, a slang term, means to test your strength \\nby seeing how much weight you can lift for one \\nultimate rep on an exercise (usually on the three \\nstrength moves: bench press, squat, and deadlift). \\nAnyone who is interested in developing muscle \\nstrength needs to routinely test 1RM strength on \\nthe bench press, squat, and deadlift.\\nAssessing your strength on the bench press, \\nsquat, and deadlift is important for several rea -\\nsons. Because the bench press represents upper-\\nbody strength, the squat represents lower-body \\nstrength, and the deadlift represents whole-body \\nstrength, knowing your maximal strength on each \\nof these lifts will give you an indication of your over-\\nall body strength as well as indicate any strength \\nimbalances you may have. Norms have been estab-\\nlished that indicate how strong a person should be \\non each of these lifts. For strength norms relative \\nto body weight, refer to table 10.1. Testing your \\n1RM on the bench press, squat, and deadlift and \\ncomparing your relative strength on each to the \\nestablished norms will indicate how your strength \\nlevels compare to the strength levels of others. \\nYou can do this by dividing your 1RM in pounds'),\n",

For \\nexample, if your bench press 1RM is 300 pounds \\nand you weigh 150 pounds (68 kilograms), your \\nrelative strength on the bench press is 2. The \\nBalanced Strength box provides a ratio of squat \\nto deadlift to bench press strength. Comparing \\nyour own 1RM strength ratios of these three lifts \\ncan indicate whether you have balanced strength \\nor whether you are particularly weak or strong \\non a particular lift. Knowing whether you have an \\nimbalance can help you tailor your training to work \\ntoward improving the weaker lifts.\\nAnother important reason to assess your 1RM \\nstrength on the bench press, squat, and deadlift \\nis to determine the training weights that will cor -\\nrespond to each phase of your strength training \\nprogram. When training for strength, you will train \\nusing a percentage of your 1RM on the major \\nlifts—such as 85 percent of the 1RM or 85 percent \\nRM. The only way to know how much weight you \\nshould train with is to know how much your 1RM \\nis. For example, if your current 1RM on the squat \\nis 400 pounds and you are in a training phase that \\nrequires 85 percent RM, then you should train with \\n340 pounds on the squat. This requires frequent \\nretesting because your strength will increase while \\nyou are training with effective strength programs. \\nYou should plan on testing your 1RM about once \\nevery four to six weeks to keep your training \\nweights accurate with your current level of strength.\\nLast and most obvious, it’s important to test \\nyour 1RM strength to assess the effectiveness \\nof each program you use in your strength training \\nTABLE 10.1 Relative Strength\\nValues listed as “good” represent 1RM that is greater \\nthan the general population. Values listed as “excellent” \\nrepresent observed 1RM values for advanced lifters. \\nValues listed as “elite” represent observed 1RM values \\nfor competitive-level powerlifters.\\nRating Male Female\\nBENCH PRESS\\nGood >1.25 × body weight >0.8 × body weight\\nExcellent ≥1.75 × body weight 1 × body weight\\nElite ≥2 × body weight ≥1.25 × body weight\\nSQUAT\\nGood >2 × body weight >1.5 × body weight\\nExcellent ≥2.5 × body weight ≥2 × body weight\\nElite ≥3 × body weight ≥2.5 × body weight\\nDEADLIFT\\nGood ≥2 × body weight ≥1.5 × body weight\\nExcellent ≥2.5 × body weight ≥2 × body weight\\nElite ≥3 × body weight ≥2.5 × body weight\\nBalanced Strength\\nHere I list the suggested ratio of bench press to squat to deadlift 1RM weight. This can be used to \\ndetermine whether your upper-body, lower-body, and overall strength are balanced. Having a ratio on \\na lift that is much higher or lower than the suggested ratios would indicate areas in which you should \\nwork on bringing your strength up to par with the others.\\nA balanced ratio of bench to squat to deadlift is 1:1.5:1.5.*\\nFor example, if your bench press is 300 pounds, your squat is 450 pounds, and your deadlift is \\n425 pounds (300:450:425), your ratio would be 1:1.5:1.4.\\nThis would suggest your strength in these three lifts is balanced.\\nIf your bench press is 300 pounds, your squat is 700 pounds, and your deadlift is 650 pounds \\n(300:700:650), your ratio would be 1:2.33:2.17.\\nThis would suggest your strength on the bench press is well below your squat and deadlift strength. \\nThis means your training should focus on bringing up your bench press and upper-body strength.\\n*In practice the weight for the deadlift tends to be slightly less than the weight for the squat.\\nregimen. Knowing your 1RM for the bench press, \\nsquat, and deadlift (or any other exercise you want \\nto increase your strength on) before you start a \\nprogram and after you finish it is the only way to \\ndetermine how effective a strength training pro -\\ngram is and whether you should consider using \\nthe same program in the future.\\nTo test your maximal strength on an exercise, \\nyou must have a capable spotter to assist you,'),\n",

The first step to testing your 1RM \\nis to do several light warm-up sets starting with \\nthe bar itself and gradually move up in weight \\nover those several sets until you are close to your \\ntrue 1RM weight. Rest three minutes after your \\nfinal warm-up before testing your 1RM. Estimate \\na conservative 1RM weight and try it for one rep. \\nRest three to four minutes before making another \\nattempt. If you failed on the second attempt, sub-\\ntract 5 to 10 pounds and try again. If you were \\nsuccessful on the attempt, add 5 to 10 pounds \\nand try another attempt. Keep doing this, resting \\nthree to four minutes between sets until you fail \\nan attempt. The weight you lifted on the prior set \\nis your true 1RM.\\nAlthough not considered nearly as accurate, it \\nis possible to estimate your 1RM without doing a \\ntrue 1RM test. There are several equations that \\nyou can use to estimate 1RM based on how many \\nreps you can complete with a certain amount of \\nweight. This is a good option if you have an injury \\nthat could be worsened by training with extremely \\nheavy weight or if you want to avoid doing a true \\n1RM for whatever reason. The most commonly \\nused equation is the Epley formula, also known \\nas the Nebraska formula:\\n1RM = [1 + (0.0333 × reps completed)] \\n× weight lifted\\nUsing this equation, if you completed 10 reps \\non the bench press with 225 pounds, then\\n1RM = [1 + (0.0333 × 10)] × 225 pounds\\n1RM = 1.333 × 225 pounds\\n1RM = 300 pounds\\nAfter estimating your 1RM with the Nebraska \\nformula, use that weight to determine your relative \\nstrength, your training weight, or how much progress \\nyou have made with a particular strength program.\\nBEGINNER OVERALL \\nSTRENGTH PROGRAM\\nIf you have more than six months of consistent \\nlifting experience, you can take on the majority of \\nbasic strength training programs that are designed \\nto build maximal strength. The reason is that most \\nprograms for developing maximal strength start \\nwith lighter weight and higher reps and gradually \\nincrease the weight and decrease the reps per -\\nformed. This systematic progression can prepare \\nyou to hoist heavy weights. However, if you have \\nless than six months of experience, you are a \\nspecial case because of the immaturity of your \\nnervous system in regard to the specific exercises \\nthat you perform in your training regimen. Any time \\nthe body learns a new movement pattern—such \\nas the barbell squat—it requires time for nerve \\nconnections to be strengthened and muscle fiber \\ncontractions to be synchronized. These adapta -\\ntions of the nervous system can have a dramatic \\neffect on strength gains in a short period of time. \\nIt is these adaptations that make up the majority of \\nthe strength gains that beginners make. Therefore, \\nyou should design a beginner strength training \\nprogram to enhance these adaptations.\\nTo enhance the neural adaptations that you \\nneed as a beginning lifter, this program empha -\\nsizes repetition—that is in the number of reps per-\\nformed per set and the frequency of training. The \\ntraining split used is a whole-body strength training \\nsplit done on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, or \\nany three days per week allowing one full day of \\nrest between workouts (see table 10.2). In each \\nworkout a different strength exercise is empha -\\nsized and performed as the first exercise of the \\nworkout. Training the same exercises three times \\nper week helps the nervous system to “learn” the \\nmovement patterns of the exercise, strengthening \\nthe nerve connections that are required. During the \\nfirst three months of the program, the assistance \\nexercises stay the same for every workout (except \\nfor abdominal and core exercises). In the last three \\nmonths, the assistance exercises are switched \\nup in each workout to provide better variety in an \\neffort to stimulate different muscle fibers, which \\nmay help to enhance strength on the three lifts.\\nThe repetitions start out very high (20 per set \\nfor the first four weeks) and progressively drop \\nevery four weeks as the weight increases. This first \\nfour-week phase starts with weights equal to 55 \\npercent RM on most lifts. This is a great starting \\nweight if you are unaccustomed to doing particular \\nexercises.

This method is known \\nas the percentage method of training and is the most \\ncommonly used method for increasing strength. The \\nmajor differences between most training programs \\nfor developing strength involve the training split, the \\nlength of the program, the starting percent RM, and \\nthe finishing percent RM.

It follows the classical peri-\\nodization format but increases the weight in very \\nsmall increments each week—usually just 2 to 3 \\npercent of the 1RM. See table 10.3 for the details \\nof the small-step cycle. Depending on the weight \\nof your 1RM, these increments may be as small \\nas 2.5 pounds (the smallest increment available \\nwith weight plates) or as high as 25 pounds (for \\nelite powerlifters with lifts up to 800 pounds). \\nThis constant and small increase in weight used \\neach week is often referred to as \\nmicroloading. It \\nis believed that constantly challenging the muscle \\nwith progressively heavier weights forces the mus-\\ncles to adapt by increasing their capacity to produce \\nforce (that is, muscle strength). This follows the \\nprinciple of progressive overload. In addition to the \\nprescribed percent RM used each week, this cycle \\nhas scheduled retesting of the 1RM. This allows \\nfor fine-tuning of the percent RM as the 1RM will \\nincrease over the course of the training cycle.\\nTABLE 10.3 Small Steps to Strength\\nHYPERTROPHY PHASE\\nWeek Sets Reps\\nWeight \\n(% RM)\\nRest \\n(minutes)\\n 1* 5 15 55% 1-2 \\n 2 4 15 57% 1-2 \\n 3 3 12 60% 1-2 \\n 4 3 12 62% 1-2 \\n 5* 3 10 65% 1-2 \\nSTRENGTH PHASE\\n 6 5 10 67% 2 \\n 7 5 8 70% 2 \\n 8 4 8 73% 2 \\n 9* 4 7 75% 2 \\n10 3 6 77% 2 \\nPOWER PHASE\\n11 3 6 80% 3 \\n12 3 4 82% 3 \\n13* 3 4 85% 3 \\n14 3 3 87% 3 \\nPEAKING CYCLE\\n15 3 3 90% 4 \\n16 2 2 92% 4 \\n17* 2 1 95% 5 \\n18 2 1 97% 5 \\n19 Off or active rest\\n20* Competition or testing of 1RM\\n*1RM test week.\\nCountdown Cycle\\nAlthough all the basic strength training programs \\nhave some form of gradual progression where the \\nreps performed at each workout decrease over \\ntime, the countdown cycle uses a corresponding \\nsystem that matches sets, reps, and weeks that \\neach phase is followed in a 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 count-\\ndown progression. See table 10.4 for the weekly \\nprogression of the countdown cycle. To expand on \\nthis, the first phase lasts six weeks and uses six \\nsets of six reps for each exercise. The next phase \\nlasts five weeks and uses five sets of five reps. \\nThis pattern continues with each phase dropping \\none week, one set, and one rep until the final week, \\nwhere one set of one maximal rep is performed \\nfor each exercise.

After all, the longer you \\ntrain, the stronger you get; the stronger you get, \\nthe harder it is to get stronger. This is because \\ntrained lifters with greater strength are close to \\nreaching the height of their genetic strength ceiling. \\nThis advanced program is designed to encourage \\nstrength gains in even the most seasoned lifter. In \\neach of the six phases, the cycle uses an advanced \\ntraining technique to encourage strength gains. \\nThe constant cycling of weight and reps, along \\nwith the specialized training techniques, prevents \\nstagnation and promotes continual strength gains \\nthroughout the eight-month cycle.\\nThis cycle uses a squat–bench press–deadlift \\ntraining split that is meshed with a push–pull \\ntraining split. That is, the workouts are divided into \\nthree separate workouts—squat, bench press, and \\ndeadlift with upper-body pushing exercises (shoul-\\nders and triceps exercises) done with the bench \\npress day and the upper-body pulling exercises \\n(back and biceps exercises) done with the deadlift \\nday. For variety, each phase alters the order of \\nthe training split. See table 10.8, Advanced Six, \\nfor details.\\nDuring the first phase (weeks 1 to 5), the train-\\ning technique used is density training. This will \\nincrease the amount of weight you can perform 10 \\nreps with on the squat, bench press, and deadlift. \\nThis will carry over into greater strength on the 1RM \\nfor each of these lifts as well. This will be apparent \\nwhen you test your 1RM in week 6. That is the only \\ngym workout you will do in week 6.\\nIn phase 2 (weeks 7 to 9), the training days are \\nreorganized so that the deadlift day is first and the \\nsquat day is last. The bench press workout still is \\nleft in the middle to separate the two workouts that \\nboth use lower-body muscles to allow for better \\nrecovery. You will do working sets with 80 percent \\nRM—however, this will be heavier than you could \\npreviously lift because of the boost in strength from \\nthe density training. The technique for this phase is \\nforced-rep training. This is a mass-training technique \\ncovered in chapter 6. The reason it is included here \\nin a strength cycle is to encourage some growth \\nin muscle fibers—which can lend itself to greater \\nforce production and therefore muscle strength.

This will kick off the 5 \\npercent method that will carry this phase through \\nthe next seven weeks. Use the 5 percent method \\nfor each major lift and one assistance exercise \\nthat mimics the lift.

You will do working sets with \\n90 percent RM. Phase 5 (weeks 24 to 27) uses \\nanother potentiation technique known to boost \\nyour power on the three lifts. For each strength \\nexercise (squat, deadlift, and bench press), you \\nwill perform one rep with 95 percent of your 1RM \\nweight as quickly as possible. Rest for three \\nminutes and downshift to 50 percent of your \\n1RM weight and perform five reps as explosively \\nas possible. Repeat this three times to develop \\nexplosive strength. The final phase is yet another \\npotentiation program. This is basically the reverse \\nof the technique of the previous phase because it \\nuses explosive movements to enhance maximal \\nstrength. At the climax of this program your 1RM \\non all three moves will be dramatically enhanced. \\nFollow this final phase with one or two weeks of \\nactive rest before starting the cycle over or moving \\non to a new strength training cycle.\\nTABLE 10.8 Advanced Six\\nPHASE 1: WEEKS 1-5\\nWORKOUT 1: SQUAT\\nExercise Sets Reps %1RM Notes\\nSquat 10 2 (week 1) 80% Follow the density training method found in \\nchapter 9 for a goal of 10 reps.6 3 (week 2)\\n5 4 (week 3)\\n4 5 (week 4)\\n3 6 (week 5)\\nLeg press 3 10\\nLeg extension 3 10\\nLeg curl 3 10\\nStanding calf raise 4 20\\nWORKOUT 2: BENCH PRESS AND PUSH\\nBench press 10 2 (week 1) 80% Follow the density training method found in \\nchapter 9 for a goal of 10 reps.6 3 (week 2)\\n5 4 (week 3)\\n4 5 (week 4)\\n3 6 (week 5)\\nIncline dumbbell press 2 10 Perform the last set of each exercise to \\nmuscle failure.Flat dumbbell press 2 10\\nBarbell shoulder press 3 10\\nLying triceps extensions 3 10\\nHanging leg raise 4 12-15\\nWORKOUT 3: DEADLIFT AND PULL\\nDeadlift 10 2 (week 1)  80% Follow the density training method found in \\nchapter 9 for a goal of 10 reps.6 3 (week 2)\\n5 4 (week 3)\\n4 5 (week 4)\\n3 6 (week 5)'),\n",

However, after you have \\na strong base of overall strength from lifting for a \\ngood while, you may want to build up strength in \\ncertain lifts. This may be due to an imbalance of \\nstrength in a certain area. Or you may just have \\nan affinity for a particular lift and want to excel at \\nit. This is often common with the bench press. \\nThe following programs are designed to build up \\nyour strength in one lift and only one lift. However, \\nthis does not mean that you shouldn’t work on \\nincreasing your strength in the other lifts. These \\nprograms emphasize the bench press, squat, \\nor deadlift. However, they are designed to fit in \\nwith regular training splits. One way to use these \\ncycles is to alternate the three of them so that you \\nemphasize bench press strength at one phase in \\nyour training cycle, squat strength in another, and \\ndeadlift strength in another before cycling back to \\nbench press-focused training.\\nBench Press Booster Cycle\\nThis 10-week cycle involves using an upper- and \\nlower-body split so that you can train chest twice \\neach week (once on Monday with a heavy day and \\nonce on Thursday with a light day of bench press \\nwork). See table 10.9, Big Bench Routine, for \\ndetails. On the heavy chest day, all you do is bench \\npress. Weight increases and therefore repetitions \\ndecrease every three weeks until you reach the \\nlast week where you max out with your new record \\nweight. Allow three to five minutes of rest between \\nsets on your heavy bench day to keep your strength \\nup. On the light chest day you do the bench press \\nalong with the other upper-body assistance exer -\\ncises. In this workout, you’ll perform light bench \\npresses as well as dumbbell bench presses (incline \\nor flat) and flys (incline or flat). Rotate the incline \\nand flat version of these exercises so that when \\nyou do incline dumbbell presses, you follow with \\nflat flys and vice versa. Allow two to three minutes \\nof rest between sets on the light chest day.\\nPHASE 6: WEEKS 29-32\\nWORKOUT 1: DEADLIFT\\nExercise Sets Reps % 1RM Notes\\nDumbbell deadlift jump 3 3 30% \\nAlternated with deadlift 3 2-3 95%\\nBarbell row 3 2-3 95%\\nBarbell curl 3 2-3 95%\\nStanding cable crunch 3 6-8\\nWORKOUT 2: BENCH PRESS\\nPower push-up 3 3 Body weight\\nAlternated with bench \\npress\\n3 2-3 95%\\nBarbell incline press 3 2 95%\\nBarbell shoulder press 3 2 95%\\nClose-grip bench press 3 2 95%\\nHanging leg raise 3 15-20\\nWORKOUT 3: SQUAT\\nBarbell squat jump 3 3 30%\\nAlternated with squat 3 2-3 95%\\nLeg press 3 2 95%\\nStanding calf raise 3 2 95%\\nPHASE 6: WEEK 33\\nWORKOUT 1: PERFORM MID- TO LATE WEEK\\nTest your 1RM on the squat, bench press, and deadlift in that order.'),\n",

It \\nwill increase your squat weight 5 to 10 percent in \\njust six weeks. However, it does require you to squat \\nfor three days per week (see table 10.10). That \\nmakes the squat–bench press–deadlift training \\nsplit the best split to use with this program, but with \\none modification: You will squat first on all three \\nworkout days. On Monday do a full squat workout \\nwith just two extra assistance exercises for quads \\n(the leg press and leg extension) as well as one \\ncalf exercise. On Wednesday you will perform just \\nthe prescribed number of squats and no other leg \\nwork before your bench press workout. On Friday \\nyou will do the same thing before your deadlift \\nworkout. Some lifters opt to train their squats in \\nthe morning on Wednesdays and Fridays and their \\nbench presses and deadlifts in the evening.

After all, if \\nthe muscle that you have spent so much effort \\nbuilding is not readily visible, then what’s the point \\nof all that hard work? Sure, weight training has \\nmany health benefits and will improve your quality \\nof life, but those are all nice fringe benefits of the \\nmain reason you weight train—to look better. And \\nlooking better makes you feel better.\\nThe best way to enhance fat loss is with a \\nproper combination of weight training and cardio \\nalong with diet. Techniques to employ in weight \\ntraining and cardio workouts are covered later in \\nthis chapter. Nutrition advice for promoting fat loss \\nis covered in chapter 28.\\nSTRENGTH TRAINING \\nTECHNIQUES THAT ENHANCE \\nFAT LOSS\\nThe very act of weightlifting can affect fat loss by \\nincreasing both the number of calories your body \\nburns during the workout and how many calories \\nyour body burns after the workout is long over. And \\nit can now be argued that the body of someone \\nwho weight trains is better equipped at burning \\nmore fat throughout the day and storing less fat. \\nYet years of research have proven that manipulat-\\ning certain acute training variables can have an \\neven bigger impact on the calories burned during \\nworkouts and the calories burned the rest of the \\nday after the workout is over.\\nExercise Selection\\nWhile a variety of exercises is always best, there \\nare certain types of exercises that you will want \\nto include in workouts to aid in fat loss. Research \\nsuggests that using multijoint, free-weight exer -\\ncises, such as the squat, bench press, shoulder \\npress, and bent-over row, will maximize the number \\nof calories burned more than machine exercises \\nor single-joint isolation exercises. This is likely \\nbecause multijoint exercises use more muscle \\ngroups, such as those that assist the target \\nmuscle and stabilizer muscles, which stabilize the \\njoints involved. And the more muscles you use, the \\nmore calories you burn. In fact, one study found \\nthat when participants did the barbell squat, they \\nburned 50 percent more calories than when they \\ndid the leg press (Tower et al. 2005).\\nResistance and Rep Range\\nThe weight you train with and the number of reps \\nyou complete can have a big impact on your calorie \\nburn. To burn more calories during the workout, \\nhigher reps do the trick. College of New Jersey \\nresearchers found that when participants used a \\nweight that allowed them to complete 10 reps on \\nthe bench press, they burned about 10 percent \\nmore calories than when they used a weight that \\nlimited them to 5 reps (Ratamess et al. 2007). The \\nmore reps you do, the more calories you burn. On \\nthe flip side of that, several studies have shown \\nthat while using heavier weight for fewer reps \\nburns fewer calories during the workout, it burns \\nmore calories when the workout is over and you \\ngo about the rest of your day. In fact, research has \\nshown that when you work out with heavy weights'),\n",

So some \\ncombination of both heavy weight for low reps and \\nlight weight for high reps is the best way to take \\nadvantage of both benefits. This can be achieved \\nby either using both low and high rep ranges in \\neach workout or periodizing the rep ranges of the \\nprogram.\\nVolume\\nThe total number of sets you do for each muscle \\ngroup and per workout (volume) will affect the \\nnumber of calories you burn in the workout. The \\nmore sets you perform, the more work you are \\ndoing, and the more calories you end up burning. \\nSo increasing total volume of workouts is not only \\na strategy that can help to increase muscle growth, \\nas discussed in chapter 2, but it can also increase \\nthe number of calories burned. As a general rule, \\nkeeping workouts to a minimum of 20 sets and \\nideally closer to 30 or more sets per workout can \\nlead to significantly greater fat loss than workouts \\nthat are under 20 sets.\\nRep Speed\\nA fourth variable to consider is the speed of the \\nreps that you perform. Research has shown that \\ndoing reps in a fast and explosive manner can \\nincrease the number of calories you burn both \\nduring and after the workout. Researchers from \\nBall State University had weight-trained males do \\na squat exercise using 60 percent of their one-rep \\nmax at a normal pace (2 seconds on the positive \\npart of the rep and 2 seconds on the negative \\npart of the rep) or a very fast pace (1 second on \\nthe positive part of the rep and 2 seconds on the \\nnegative part of the rep). For both workouts, they \\ndid 4 sets of 8 reps, during which they were hooked \\nup to a metabolic instrument to measure the \\nnumber of calories they burned. The researchers \\ndiscovered that when the participants did the 4 \\nsets of squats with fast reps, they burned over 11 \\npercent more calories during the workout and over \\n5 percent more calories at rest after the workout \\ncompared to when they used slower reps (Mazzetti \\net al. 2007).\\nWhile you don’t want to do every exercise with \\nfast and explosive reps, a better plan is to start \\nyour workouts with one exercise for each muscle \\ngroup done in an explosive manner. For example, \\nfor chest you can start the workout with three or \\nfour sets of power push-ups or Smith machine \\nbench press throws. This will help you build muscle \\npower in the chest, which can help you gain muscle \\nstrength as you burn fat. And since ballistic exer-\\ncises like this are done with light weight, they serve \\nas a good warm-up to the heavier working sets that \\nwill follow, such as the bench press.\\nRest\\nOne of the more critical variables for increasing fat \\nloss is the rest period you allow between sets. Gen-\\nerally speaking, the less rest you allow, the greater \\nthe number of calories you burn in a workout.\\nResearch from the College of New Jersey has \\nshown that if you cut your rest periods from the \\nstandard 3 minutes between sets to just 30 sec-\\nonds between sets, you can increase the number \\nof calories you burn during the workout by over 50 \\npercent (Ratamess et al. 2007). These shorter rest \\nperiods, compared to longer rest periods, also lead \\nto a bigger increase in the metabolic rate boost \\nthat follows the workout. Research also shows \\na similar response to supersets, which basically \\neliminates any rest periods between sets. This is \\ncovered in more detail in the following section.\\nWhile you should keep rest periods between \\nsets to a minimum, the one time to hold the rest \\nperiod between sets to at least one minute, if \\nnot longer, is when using the cardio technique of \\ncardioacceleration, where instead of truly resting \\nbetween sets you do cardio between sets. To learn \\nmore about cardioacceleration, see chapter 12.\\nIntensity Techniques\\nAnother thing to consider regarding weight training \\nfor maximizing fat loss is the use of intensity tech-\\nniques that allow you to take sets past the point \\nof normal muscle failure. For example, with forced \\nreps the assistance from a partner helps you go \\npast muscle failure by continuing to do more reps \\nthan you would be able to complete on your own. \\nResearch shows that this technique leads to a \\nhigher increase in growth hormone levels than by \\nsimply ending the set at muscle failure (Ahtiainen'),\n",

Since growth hormone (GH) increases \\nlipolysis, the release of fat from the fat cells, having \\nhigher GH levels can lead to more fat being freed \\nup from the fat cells so that it can be burned away \\nas fuel during the workout and after.\\nOne study on collegiate football players found \\nthat those following a high-intensity weight pro -\\ngram, which consisted of just one set per exer -\\ncise done for 6 to 10 reps per exercise done to \\nfailure along with forced reps and finally a static \\ncontraction for several seconds, lost more body fat \\nover 10 weeks than those using a lower-intensity \\nprogram, which consisted of three sets of 6 to \\n10 reps per exercise taken to just muscle failure \\n(Fincher 2004).\\nUsing the intensity technique, supersets also \\ncan enhance calorie burning and therefore fat loss. \\nOne study from Syracuse University reported that \\nparticipants supersetting chest and back, biceps \\nand triceps, and quads and hamstrings increased \\nthe number of calories burned during the workout \\nand the hour after the workout by 35 percent more \\nthan those performing the same chest and back \\nexercises as straight sets (Kelleher et al. 2010). \\nWhile this may be because an athlete uses more \\nmuscle fibers by supersetting different muscle \\ngroups, the fact that rest periods between sup -\\nersets are minimal is likely to be a big factor as \\nwell. The influence that rest periods have between \\nsets is discussed earlier in this chapter. This would \\nlikely mean that using techniques such as tri-sets \\nand giant sets, in which you train three and four or \\nmore exercises, respectively, back to back, would \\nprovide a similar effect, if not an even bigger one.\\nTraining Frequency\\nHow often you train muscle groups can also have \\nan impact on fat loss. The most obvious reason \\nfor this is that when you train muscle groups more \\nfrequently you tend to train more often during the \\nweek. More workouts during the week equate to \\nmore total calories burned throughout the weeks.\\nAnother reason more frequent workouts lead \\nto greater fat loss is that when you train muscle \\ngroups more frequently, you need to train more \\nmuscle groups per workout. This means that you \\nhave more muscle tissue that is recovering after \\nthe workout is over. After workouts your body is in a \\nstate known as oxygen debt. That means it needs \\nmore oxygen to replenish ATP and phosphocreatine \\nstores. It needs that oxygen to burn more fuel \\n(calories) to recover from the workout. With more \\nmuscle fibers needed to recover, the calorie burn \\nstays higher for longer.\\nSUMMARY\\nThe way in which you design your weight training \\nprogram can significantly affect fat loss. Generally \\nspeaking, programs that use many multijoint move-\\nments, incorporate explosive and ballistic training \\nexercises, use heavy weight for fewer reps, use \\nlighter weight for higher reps, keep rest periods \\nvery short, combine techniques such as supersets, \\nemploy intensity techniques such as forced reps, \\ntrain muscle groups more frequently, or have you in \\nthe gym more often all seem to be effective ways \\nto keep fat burning maximized.\\nOf course, you can’t employ all of these tech -\\nniques into every workout, but a good strategy is \\nto employ a multitude of these techniques in each \\nprogram you design and swap out techniques as \\nyou change up programs. You will also need to add \\nsome form of cardio to these strength programs in \\norder to maximize fat loss. Cardio techniques that \\nwork best are covered in chapter 12.\\nIf you are not keen at designing your own \\ntraining programs, turn to chapter 13, which has \\nseveral fat-loss programs. Not only have these \\nprograms been shown to be effective for fat loss, \\nbut trainees often have gains in muscle size and \\nstrength. These programs also serve as a good \\ntemplate for combining the techniques discussed \\nin this chapter.'),\n",

Aerobic exercise refers to the energy system \\nused. With weight training, which is done with high \\nintensity for short bursts followed by a short rest \\nperiod, you tend to rely more on the anaerobic \\nenergy systems to fuel muscle contractions. With \\naerobic exercise, which typically refers to rhyth -\\nmic movement at a low to moderate intensity for \\nprolonged periods, such as jogging or bicycling, \\nthe energy systems that fuel this type of activity \\nrequire oxygen.\\nAlthough it is possible to lose fat with just weight \\ntraining, especially certain types of programs, to \\ntruly maximize fat loss you need to incorporate \\nsome form of cardio in your training regimen. Plus, \\ncardio provides health benefits, such as improved \\ncardiovascular health, reduced risk of diabetes \\nand other metabolic diseases, and reduced risk of \\ncertain types of cancer. It can also help to enhance \\nrecovery from weight training. This chapter covers \\nthe most effective forms of cardio for fat loss while \\nmaintaining muscle and building muscle.\\nHIIT VERSUS STEADY-STATE \\nCARDIO\\nThere was a time when bodybuilders would only \\nconsider doing low- to moderate-intensity, steady-\\nstate cardio, such as fast walking or pedaling a \\nstationary bike at a moderate intensity. Anything \\nmore intense would be considered a no-no. There \\nwere two main reasons for this. The first was that \\nthey believed that more intense cardio would burn \\nup muscle tissue (meaning that muscle tissue \\nwould be broken down to fuel the exercise). The \\nsecond belief was that lower-intensity cardio was \\nreported to put a person in an optimal fat-burning \\nzone.\\nToday, we know that both of those lines of \\nthinking are flawed. The concept that high-intensity \\ncardio will burn up muscle while low-intensity cardio \\nwill spare muscle is quite wrong. In fact, if you just \\ncompared the muscle mass of longer-distance \\nrunners (who spend a good deal of their training \\nat a slower pace for longer periods) to the muscle \\nmass of sprinters (who spend a good deal of their \\ntraining at higher intensities for short periods), you \\ncould see how that logic is flawed.\\nWhen you train at a slow and steady pace for a \\nlonger period, you train your muscle fibers to be \\nmore aerobic and have greater endurance. There \\nis some evidence that suggests that muscle fibers \\nadapt to becoming more aerobic and to increas -\\ning endurance by becoming smaller and weaker. \\nThis is because the smaller a muscle fiber is, the \\nless time it takes for nutrients to travel within the \\nmuscle fiber. This speeds up the rate that nutrients \\ncan be burned for fuel.\\nAnother way to consider the misconception \\nthat low-intensity cardio done for longer periods \\nwill better spare muscle mass than high-intensity \\ncardio for shorter periods is to compare a high -\\ner-intensity squat workout done for 5 sets with a \\nweight that limits you to 10 reps per set and a low-\\ner-intensity squat workout done with a weight that \\nallows you to complete 100 reps per set.

So to burn an equivalent amount \\nof calories and fat as higher-intensity cardio, you \\nwould have to exercise for considerably longer. \\nOne obvious problem with doing excessive cardio \\nis time. Most people barely have time to fit in a \\n60-minute weight workout, let alone another 60 \\nminutes or longer of cardio. However, another \\nproblem with excessively long cardio, particularly \\nfor men, is that it has been found to lower testos-\\nterone levels.\\nFocusing on just how many calories you burn \\nand how many calories you burn from fat during a \\nworkout is also flawed. The real benefit of cardio \\nfor fat loss is the amount of calories (and calories \\nfrom fat) that you burn the rest of the day after the \\nworkout is over. This is due to the process known \\nas EPOC (excess postexercise oxygen consump -\\ntion). It refers to the boost in your metabolism, or \\ncalorie burning that comes after the workout is \\nover. When you work out, you burn calories to fuel \\nyour muscles. But when the workout is over, your \\nbody keeps burning more calories than normal, \\ndespite the fact that you are doing nothing. This \\nis due to the processes involved in recovery from \\nexercise. After exercise, your body must repair \\ndamaged muscle fibers, restock muscle glycogen \\nlevels, remove lactic acid from the muscles, and \\nso on. All these processes require calories, and \\na lot of those calories come from fat. And when it \\ncomes to EPOC, this is where HIIT really destroys \\nsteady-state cardio done at a lower intensity.\\nScience Behind HIIT\\nHigh-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a form \\nof cardio that involves intervals of high-intensity \\nexercise (such as running at a very fast pace) \\ninterspersed with intervals of low-intensity activity \\n(walking at a slow pace) or complete rest. This is \\nin sharp contrast to the typical continuous steady-\\nstate (slow and steady) exercise that is done at a \\nmoderate intensity, such as walking at a fast pace \\nor jogging for 30 to 60 minutes.\\nAlthough HIIT seems to have gained popularity in \\nthe last few years, the concept is actually quite old. \\nThe origin of HIIT can be traced back many decades \\nto a technique called Fartlek training that was used \\nby track coaches to better prepare runners. Fartlek \\nis actually Swedish for speed (fart) and play (lek), \\nso it means speed play, which is essentially what \\nHIIT is. Today HIIT has crossed over to the fitness \\nindustry because of its beneficial results that have \\nbeen established through both anecdotal reports \\nand published research studies. In fact, studies \\ncomparing HIIT to continuous steady-state cardio \\nhave shown that HIIT is far superior for fat loss, \\ndespite the fact that it requires much less time.\\nOne of the first studies to discover that HIIT \\nwas more effective for fat loss was a 1994 study \\nby researchers at Laval University in Ste-Foy, \\nQuebec, Canada (Tremblay et al. 1994). They \\nreported that young men and women who followed \\na 15-week HIIT program lost significantly more \\nbody fat than those following a 20-week continu-\\nous steady-state endurance program, despite the \\nfact that the steady-state program burned about \\n15,000 calories more during exercise than the \\nHIIT program. A 2001 study from East Tennessee \\nState University demonstrated similar findings \\nwith participants who followed an 8-week HIIT \\nprogram (participants dropped 2 percent body \\nfat) compared to those who followed a continuous \\nsteady-state program (participants had no drop \\nin body fat) on a treadmill (King 2001). A study \\nfrom Australia reported that females following \\na 20-minute HIIT program that consisted of \\n8-second sprints followed by 12 seconds of rest \\nlost 6 times more body fat than the group who \\nfollowed a 40-minute cardio program performed \\nat a constant intensity of 60 percent of their \\nmaximum heart rate (Trapp 2008).\\nA study from the University of Western Ontario \\nsuggests that you can burn off more body fat \\nwith even less than 15 minutes of HIIT than with \\nslow and steady cardio (Macpherson 2011). The \\nresearch team had male and female participants \\nfollow one of two cardio programs for six weeks. \\nOne group ran slow and steady for 30 to 60 min-\\nutes three times per week. The other group did \\nfour to six 30-second sprints with a 4-minute rest \\nperiod between sprints three times per week. \\nThat’s basically HIIT with an extended rest interval \\nbetween the high-intensity exercise intervals. The \\ngroup doing the sprint intervals lost more than \\ntwice as much body fat as the slow-and-steady \\ngroup despite the fact that they did only 2 to 3 \\nminutes of total cardio exercise per day and just \\n6 to 9 minutes per week! The sprint interval group \\nalso gained over one pound of muscle. So this type \\nof cardio not only burns off body fat and spares \\nmuscle, but it also may even help to build it.'),\n",

Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine \\nreported that participants who followed a HIIT \\nworkout on a stationary cycle burned significantly \\nmore calories during the 24 hours after the work-\\nout than those who cycled at a moderate steady-\\nstate intensity (Treuth, 1996). The East Tennessee \\nState University study mentioned earlier also \\nfound that participants following the HIIT program \\nburned more calories during the 24 hours after \\nexercise than the steady-state cardio group did. \\nA study presented at the 2007 annual meeting \\nof the American College of Sports Medicine by \\nFlorida State University researchers reported that \\nparticipants who performed HIIT burned about 10% \\nmore calories during the 24 hours after exercise \\nas those who performed continuous steady-state \\nexercise, despite the fact that the total calories \\nburned during the workouts were the same (Meuret \\net al. 2007).\\nIn addition to the increase in resting metabo -\\nlism, research confirms that HIIT is effective at \\nenhancing the metabolic machinery in muscle cells \\nthat promote fat burning and blunt fat production. \\nResearchers in the Laval University study that \\nfound a decrease in body fat with HIIT discovered \\nthat the HIIT participants’ muscle fibers had \\nsignificantly higher markers for fat oxidation (fat \\nburning) than those in the continuous steady-state \\nexercise group. A study of young females who per-\\nformed seven HIIT workouts over a two-week period \\nshowed a 30 percent increase in both fat oxidation \\nand levels of muscle enzymes that enhance fat oxi-\\ndation (Talanian et al. 2007). Research shows that \\nthis may be due to an increase in mitochondria, \\nthe machinery in muscle cells and other cells that \\nburns fat to produce energy. Scalzo and colleagues \\n(2014) found that both men and women complet-\\ning four to eight bouts of 30-seocnd sprints on a \\nstationary cycle had significant boosts in mitochon-\\ndrial biogenesis. In a study from the Norwegian \\nUniversity of Science and Technology, participants \\nwith metabolic syndrome who followed a 16-week \\nHIIT program had a 100 percent greater decrease \\nin content of the fat-producing enzyme fatty acid \\nsynthase compared to participants who followed \\ncontinuous moderate-intensity exercise. In other \\nwords, HIIT enhances the body’s ability to burn \\nfat and prevent the storage of fat (Tjonna 2007).\\nAnother way that HIIT appears to work has to do \\nwith getting the fat to where it will be burned away \\nfor good. Talanian and colleagues (2010) shed \\nsome light on another way that HIIT burns more \\nbody fat: 6 weeks of HIIT increased the amount of \\nspecial proteins in muscle cells that are respon -\\nsible for carrying fat into the mitochondria (where \\nfat is burned for fuel) by up to 50 percent. Having \\nmore of these proteins in muscle means that more \\nfat can be burned up for fuel during workouts and \\nwhen resting.\\nHIIT , done at a higher intensity for a shorter \\ntime, will not only help you maintain your muscle \\nbut can actually help you build muscle mass. In a \\nstudy by Smith and colleagues (2009), male par-\\nticipants following a six-week HIIT program (done \\nfor 15 minutes per day, 3 days a week, at a ratio \\nof 2:1 for exercise to rest) while supplementing \\nwith beta-alanine gained over 2 pounds of muscle \\ndespite the fact that they never lifted weights \\nduring the program. The 2011 study on sprinting \\nfrom the University of Western Ontario discussed \\nearlier reported that those performing 30-second \\nsprint intervals actually gained some muscle mass, \\nwhile the slow-and-steady cardio group did not. \\nA study from the UK reported that obese partici -\\npants following a low-carbohydrate diet lost muscle \\nmass, yet those performing HIIT along with the \\nlow-carbohydrate diet were able to maintain muscle \\nmass (Sartor 2010). This makes sense when you \\nconsider that weight training is technically a form \\nof HIIT— short periods of high-intensity exercise \\nare interspersed with periods of rest.\\nOne reason HIIT can lead to greater gains in \\nmuscle mass may be an increase in muscle protein \\nsynthesis. The Colorado State University study \\nshowing an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis \\nalso reported a significant increase in muscle \\nprotein synthesis after the sprints. The results \\nwere greater in male than in female participants. \\nAnother reason for greater gains in muscle mass \\nwith HIIT may be the anabolic hormone testos -\\nterone. New Zealand researchers (Paton et al. \\n2009) had competitive cyclists complete 4 weeks \\nof HIIT training involving 30-second sprints on \\na stationary cycle separated by 30 seconds of \\nrest. One group sprinted with high resistance on \\nthe pedals, making it harder to pedal, while the \\nother group used a lighter resistance, which was \\neasier to pedal. Both groups pedaled as fast as \\nthey could during the 30-second sprints. The men \\npedaling at the highest resistance increased their'),\n",

When you improve insulin sensitivity, not \\nonly does this help you keep lean and prevent dia-\\nbetes, but it can also aid muscle growth. Insulin is \\nan anabolic hormone that acts on the muscle cells \\nto increase muscle protein synthesis, decrease \\nmuscle protein breakdown, and drive more glu -\\ncose, amino acids, and creatine and carnitine \\ninto muscle cells. Researchers at Watt University \\nin Edinburgh had participants follow a two-week \\ntraining program with workouts consisting of just \\nfour to six 30-second sprints on stationary cycles \\n(Babraj et al. 2009). Sprints were separated by 4 \\nminutes of rest. They discovered that at the end of \\nthe two weeks the participants’ blood glucose and \\ninsulin levels were reduced by almost 15 and 40 \\npercent, respectively, after the consumption of 75 \\ngrams of glucose. Insulin sensitivity, which is the \\nmeasurement of how well insulin does its job at the \\nmuscle cells, improved by about 25 percent. In a \\nmore recent study by Racil and colleagues (2013), \\nyoung females following a 12-week HIIT program \\nhad positive changes in insulin sensitivity as well \\nas reduced waist size, lower total cholesterol, lower \\nLDL cholesterol, and higher HDL cholesterol.\\nThis does not mean that you should never do \\nsteady-state cardio. If you enjoy jogging, hiking, or \\ncycling, then by all means include that exercise in \\nyour program. However, you should still consider \\nadding a few days of HIIT into your routine. This \\nnot only will improve your physique but will also \\nimprove your performance when you do steady-\\nstate cardio.\\nCardio Frequency\\nMany weight training enthusiasts ask about the \\nminimum amount of cardio that needs to be done \\neach week to result in fat loss? This question \\nusually comes from those who think that cardio is \\nonly the slow-and-steady type done on a treadmill \\nor stationary bike. Most people who enjoy weight-\\nlifting tend to loathe cardio. Of course, once they \\nrealize that cardio can be done with weights in HIIT \\nstyle, they end up asking how much is too much. \\nAt any rate, there is some evidence both from \\nresearch and anecdotal reports that the minimum \\namount of cardio that you should do each week is \\nthree workouts.\\nOne study placed 90 male and female partici -\\npants on an eight-week program that consisted of \\n30 minutes of straight cardio (Willis et al. 2009). \\nThey divided the participants into groups based on \\nhow often they exercised each week. One group \\nserved as a control and did no exercise, a second \\ngroup did the cardio workout fewer than two times \\na week, a third group did the workouts two or three \\ntimes per week, and the fourth group did cardio \\nfour or more times per week. They discovered that \\nat the end of the eight weeks only the last group \\nperforming cardio four or more times per week lost \\na decent amount of body fat (almost 15 pounds \\nof it). Of course, the participants were not weight \\ntraining in addition to doing cardio, and they also \\nweren’t doing HIIT , so it’s hard to say from this \\nstudy precisely how many days of cardio you need \\nin addition to weight training.\\nAnecdotal reports suggest a minimum of three \\nHIIT cardio sessions per week in addition to weight \\ntraining. But obviously, the more you do each \\nweek, the greater the expected fat loss. In fact, \\nyou can do seven days of cardio per week if you \\nprefer. And that can be seven days of HIIT . Some \\nare worried that doing HIIT every day will lead to \\novertraining. However, as long as you switch up \\nthe exercises, you can do HIIT every day of the \\nweek. After all, it is typically done for only 15 to \\n30 minutes, and that is not total exercise time. \\nResearch on athletes suggests that those using \\nHIIT every day had no decrement in performance. \\nHatle et al. (2014) found that those performing \\neight sessions of HIIT per week for 3 weeks had \\nsimilar increases in V·O\\n2max as those doing three \\nsessions per week for 8 weeks. This supports an \\nearlier study in Alpine skiers (Breil et al. 2010) that \\nshowed a 6 percent increase in V·O\\n2max after 15 \\nsessions of HIIT performed for 11 days. Both stud-\\nies, however, reported that the increase in V·O2max \\nwas not apparent until several days after stopping \\nthe frequent HIIT . This suggests that performing \\nHIIT every day could overtax the body and lead to \\novertraining. So if improving aerobic performance \\nis one of your goals, you should provide at least \\none rest day, if not three or four, per week. However, \\ndoing two or three weeks of HIIT every day can lead \\nto quicker improvements in endurance as long as \\nyou back off on the frequency later on. For the best \\nfat loss, do three to six sessions of HIIT per week, \\nleaving a minimum of one day of rest.'),\n",

The most critical \\naspect of scheduling your cardio is when you will \\nbe most consistent doing it.\\nIf you find that you tend to skip your cardio \\nworkouts when you leave it to after your weight \\nworkout, then you should consider doing it before \\nor during your weight training workout or at a com-\\npletely different time or day. There are two options \\nwhen it comes to doing cardio during your weight \\ntraining workouts. The first option is to do cardio-\\nacceleration, which involves a 30- to 90-second \\nbout of high-intensity cardio in between every set. \\nOr you can do a bout of HIIT in between muscle \\ngroups. For example, if you train back, biceps, and \\ncalves in one workout, you could do 10 minutes \\nof HIIT in between back and biceps, in between \\nbiceps and calves, and after calves for a total of \\n30 minutes of HIIT . Several studies have reported \\nthat breaking up your cardio into several shorter \\nsessions allows you to burn more calories during \\nthe workout as well as more calories after the \\nworkout is over (Altena 2003; Almuzaini 1998; \\nKaminsky 1990). This has also been shown to \\nallow people to lose significantly more total fat \\nover a prolonged period.\\nFasted Cardio\\nAnother misconception about cardio is that the \\nbest time to do it is first thing in the morning \\non an empty stomach. Research does in fact \\nshow that you burn more total fat when you do \\ncardio fasted than you would if you ate first. \\nSome research shows that you can burn 20 \\npercent more fat when you do cardio in the \\nmorning on an empty stomach (Gonzalez et al. \\n2013). However, as mentioned earlier, how many \\ncalories—and specifically the number you burn \\nfrom fat—during the exercise should not be the \\nmajor focus. When you burn carbohydrate during \\nexercise, you burn more fat after the exercise is \\nover, and when you burn more fat during exer -\\ncise, you burn more carbohydrate after (Deighton \\n2012). In other words, it’s more about the total \\namount of calories and fat you burn throughout \\nthe day, not just during exercise. Research also \\nsuggests that whether you exercise first thing in \\nthe morning fasted or fed, you end up burning \\nthe same amount of calories throughout the day \\n(Hansen 2005).\\nSo, generally speaking, your best bet is to not \\nworry about doing cardio first thing in the morning \\nor fasted. If doing cardio first thing in the morning \\nis best for your schedule, then by all means do \\nyour cardio then. But it is advisable to have at \\nleast a protein shake—ideally a protein shake \\nand some carbohydrate, such as fruit—before \\nthe workout. If you are trying to limit carb intake, \\nthen you may want to avoid the carbohydrate until \\nafter the workout.\\nThere is one time when fasted cardio may be \\na strategy you want to employ. I have found that \\nwhen a male’s body fat is in the low single digits \\n(somewhere around 5 to 6 percent) or a female’s \\nbody fat is in the low teens (somewhere around 13 \\nto 14 percent), but they have one body area that \\nthey cannot trim, then the fasted cardio seems \\nto be beneficial for dropping the stubborn fat. For \\nexample, many males, especially older males, tend \\nto hold fat on the lower back and obliques. Many \\nfemales tend to hold fat on the hips and thighs. \\nOnce they have dropped the majority of the subcu-\\ntaneous fat on the rest of the body, fasted cardio \\ndoes seem to work well to rid that last bit of fat. \\nAlthough there are no direct data, it may be that \\nwhen a person is so low in body fat, encouraging \\nthe body to burn more fat during exercise is one \\nway to burn off the stubborn body fat that other -\\nwise won’t go.\\nFORMS OF HIIT\\nHIIT can take on many forms and be done with \\nvirtually any equipment or absolutely none. You \\ncan do it while running on a track or a treadmill, \\nriding a stationary bike or climbing a stair stepper, \\nor doing calisthenics and using your body weight \\nor explosive exercises and free weights. Chapters \\n25 (whole-body exercises) and 26 (calisthenic \\nexercises) are good resources for exercises to \\nuse for HIIT .\\nThere is almost no wrong way to use HIIT other \\nthan not doing it at all. And while there are numer-\\nous exercises that you can do with HIIT , there are \\nalso numerous ways to employ HIIT . Following are \\nsome of the more effective ways to use HIIT .'),\n",

Some evidence suggests that when \\ndoing HIIT , a ratio of 2:1 of high-intensity exercise \\nto low-intensity exercise, or work to rest, provides \\nthe best benefits in performance, fat loss, and \\nhealth. For example, you could sprint as fast as \\npossible for 30 seconds and walk for 15 seconds. \\nOr you could jump rope for 1 minute and rest for 30 \\nseconds. Of course, studies like the University of \\nWestern Ontario study on sprinting for 30 seconds \\nand resting for 4 minutes suggest that results \\nare still substantial even with a HIIT work-to-rest \\nratio of 1:8. Despite that, I would still recommend \\nshooting for a 2:1 ratio. If that is too much for you \\nto handle at first, start off with a 1:2, or a 1:4, \\nor even a 1:8 ratio of work to rest and gradually \\nincrease the ratio over time.\\nThe intensity of the high-intensity exercise inter-\\nvals can be something that is tightly prescribed, \\nsuch as a certain percent of your maximum heart \\nrate, or loosely determined based on what feels \\nintense to you. Because I prefer to do a variety \\nof exercises, such as dumbbell cleans, kettlebell \\nswings, and bench step-ups, checking your heart \\nrate manually or even on a heart rate monitor is \\npretty impractical. So I prefer to use a simple RPE \\n(rating of perceived exertion) scale of 1 to 10, as \\nshown in table 12.1. During the high-intensity exer-\\ncise intervals you should be somewhere from 6 to \\n9. Stick with the lower end of that range when just \\nbeginning with the goal of increasing your RPE as \\nyou go. If you are not taking complete rest between \\nthe high-intensity exercise intervals, then your RPE \\nduring the low-intensity exercise intervals should \\nbe somewhere in the range of 1 to 3.\\nYou should also shoot to increase the block \\nof total time spent doing HIIT as you progress. \\nEven if you start with just 10 to 15 minutes, that \\nis fine. But your goal should be to slowly increase \\nyour total time.\\nBeginner to Advanced HIIT Program\\nThe HIIT program in table 12.2 will progress you \\nfrom the beginner level to the intermediate level \\nof HIIT proficiency. This can be done with any \\nequipment, such as a treadmill, jump rope, pair \\nof dumbbells, kettlebell, exercise bands, medicine \\nball, TRX, or just your body weight and calisthenics.\\nThe suggested time of each phase is not carved \\nin stone. If you feel you need to spend more than \\ntwo weeks at a particular phase before moving \\nup, then do so. Or if a phase seems too easy and \\nyou want to jump right up to the next phase, then \\ndo so. It starts with a work-to-rest ratio of 1:4 in \\nphase 1 for a total workout time of just under 15 \\nminutes. Then in phase 2, it bumps up the amount \\nof time in the work phase to bring the ratio up to \\n1:2 and the total workout time to 17 minutes. In \\nphase 3, the rest is cut in half to bring the ratio \\nup to 1:1, and the total workout time increases \\nto 18.5 minutes. And finally in phase 4, the rest \\nis cut in half again to get the ratio to 2:1 and the \\ntotal time at 20 minutes.\\nTabata Intervals\\nTabata intervals use a 2:1 ratio of work to rest. \\nBut specifically you alternate 20 seconds of high-in-\\ntensity exercise with 10 seconds of rest done for \\neight cycles in this fashion for a total of 4 minutes \\nper exercise. The point is to not fall into a specific \\nheart rate range but to just go as intensely as \\npossible. So shoot for an RPE of about 9 to 10.\\nTabatas are named after the Japanese scien -\\ntist who designed them, Dr. Izumi Tabata.

For example, if you \\ntrained chest, triceps, and abs in one workout, you \\ncould start with Tabata rope jumping for 4 minutes \\nto warm up. Then after finishing chest, do Tabata \\nkettlebell swings for 4 minutes and Tabata bench \\nstep-ups for another 4 minutes before training \\ntriceps. After triceps, you could do 4 minutes of \\nTabata dumbbell cleans and Tabata jumping jacks \\nbefore training abs. Then you do more two more \\nTabata-style exercises after abs for a total time of \\n28 minutes of Tabata HIIT .\\nA typical Tabata exercise would look like this, \\nusing kettlebell swings as an example:\\nTime Activity\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\nPower HIIT\\nPower HIIT involves doing intervals of explosive \\nexercises with short intervals of rest. These exer-\\ncises could include power cleans, snatches, squat \\njumps, power push-ups, and kettlebell swings. \\nThese exercises are typically done to develop \\nexplosive power, strength, and speed for sport \\nperformance. Combining them with HIIT allows you \\nto build more muscle power while increasing fat \\nloss and cardiorespiratory conditioning.\\nWith Power HIIT , both the exercise intervals and \\nthe rest intervals last 20 seconds. So it works on \\na 1:1 ratio of exercise to rest. This time frame \\ntypically allows you to complete about 3 or 4 reps \\nduring each exercise interval. This rep range is \\nperfect for building power. Then you get an equal \\namount of time to recover to help you better main-\\ntain power on the next exercise interval. This 1:1 \\nwork-to-rest ratio can also help to build muscle \\nsize, strength, and power by boosting testosterone \\nlevels. The New Zealand study discussed earlier \\nfound that cyclists performing 30-second high-pow-\\nered sprints separated by 30 seconds of rest (1:1 \\nwork-to-rest ratio) increased their testosterone \\nlevels by up to 100 percent.\\nFor each exercise you do three exercise-to-rest \\nintervals and then move on to the next exercises. \\nThis way you have worked at building power on \\nthat exercise without completely exhausting the \\nspecific muscles used on that move.\\nThe power exercises in Power HIIT are very fast \\nand explosive. These fast reps primarily recruit the \\nfast-twitch muscle fibers, which grow the biggest, \\nstrongest, and fastest. So it’s easy to understand \\nhow using HIIT workouts can help you build muscle \\nand power. But the fast-twitch muscle fibers also \\nburn the most calories when you use them, as \\ndiscussed in chapter 11. Plus, most of the exer -\\ncises in Power HIIT use so many muscle groups \\nthat they also burn more calories that way, as also \\ndiscussed in chapter 11.\\nPower HIIT Workouts\\nStart each Power HIIT workout with a 5-minute HIIT \\nwarm-up of rope jumping or jumping jacks. This \\nwarm-up should be done in typical HIIT fashion \\nat a 2:1 ratio of jumping to rest. In this case, it’s \\n30 seconds of jumping followed by 15 seconds \\nof rest. You do 7 cycles of this for a total of 5 \\nminutes. If you do the Power HIIT workouts after \\nweight training, then you do not need to do the \\n5-minute HIIT warm-up.\\nAfter the jump rope HIIT warm-up (see table \\n12.3), go right into the Power HIIT workout (see \\ntable 12.4). You do three 20-second sets of each \\nexercise, taking 20 seconds of rest between sets \\nand exercises. In workout A, start with squat jumps \\n(chapter 21) for building leg power. Then you move \\ninto power push-ups (chapter 14) for building power \\nin the chest and triceps. Next power cleans (chap-\\nter 25) are done with dumbbells or a barbell. Then \\nit’s on to medicine ball overhead throws (chapter \\n25). If you don’t have a medicine ball, you can \\nsimply do band shoulder presses (chapter 15) or \\neven barbell or dumbbell push presses (chapter \\n25). Finish with the band standing crunch (chapter \\n24) to build strength and power in the midsection.'),\n",

Since you \\nhave to do both sides of the body, instead of doing \\nthree sets of 20 seconds each, do two 20-second \\nsets on each side for a total of four sets.\\nIn both workouts A and B you do five exercises \\nfor three 20-second sets each (except in workout \\nB where you have an extra set for woodchoppers) \\nwith 20-second rest periods; this totals 10 min -\\nutes.

So, for exam-\\nple, on chest day, you would do one set of the \\nbench press; then instead of sitting on the bench \\nfor 2 to 3 minutes resting, you perform 30 to 90 \\nseconds of high-intensity cardio. Then you go do \\nthe next set of bench presses and continue in this \\nmanner throughout the entire workout.\\nMultiply those 30 to 90 seconds of cardio by the \\nnumber of sets you complete in each workout, and \\nit adds up. If you train chest, triceps, and abs, and \\ndo 12 sets for chest, 9 sets for triceps, and 9 sets \\nfor abs (30 total sets), and complete 60 seconds of \\ncardio between each set, then you just completed \\n30 minutes of high-intensity cardio during your \\nchest, triceps, and ab workout. That means that \\nyou don’t have to spend extra time doing cardio \\nafter the weight workout is over or on a separate \\nday. You can rest assured you’ve done your weight \\ntraining and your cardio, all in one fell swoop.\\nAlthough it may not be readily apparent, cardio-\\nacceleration is a form of HIIT . You are doing 30- to \\n90-second intervals of cardio and then moving on to \\na set of weightlifting. Then you go back to the cardio \\ninterval, and then back to the weight training interval.\\nCardioacceleration is based on a study by Uni-\\nversity of California at Santa Cruz researchers. \\nTrained participants completing 30 to 60 seconds \\nof cardio in between sets of weight training for over \\ntwo months recovered better than those resting \\nnormally between sets (Davis et al. 2008). Not only \\ndoes this method of HIIT allow for better recovery \\nafter workouts, but it allows for greater recovery \\nbetween sets. It is surprising that this technique \\nworks so well in aiding recovery between sets. In \\nfact, in my programs it has helped thousands of \\nmen and women break PRs while getting leaner \\nat the same time. Many worry that doing cardio \\nin between sets will decrease strength in weight-\\nlifting, but as I have found, once the body adapts \\nto the cardioacceleration, it appears to enhance \\nstrength and recovery between sets.\\nAnother nice thing about cardioacceleration is \\nthat it does not mean that you have to use the \\ntreadmill or other typical form of cardio equip -\\nment. You can do the cardio interval right there \\nat the station where you are weight training. So, \\nfor example, if you are doing the bench press, you \\ncan do 30 to 90 seconds of bench step-ups on \\nthe bench-press bench. If you’re doing dumbbell \\nflys, then do dumbbell cleans for cardio right next \\nto your bench. Or the simplest exercise of all is to \\nrun in place. This way you do not lose your spot in \\na busy gym. For good exercises to use for cardio-\\nacceleration, see chapter 26. Many exercises in \\nchapter 25 also work well for cardioacceleration.\\nStart at on the low end of scale with 30 sec -\\nonds of cardio in between sets. Over time, you \\ncan increase that by 15 seconds until you are \\nup to doing 90 seconds of cardioacceleration in'),\n",

It also uses two forms of periodization: \\nlinear and reverse linear. The program splits each \\nmuscle group into two workouts each week. The \\nfirst half of the week (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednes-\\nday) you train using mainly multijoint exercises. For \\nexample, for chest you will only do presses using \\nboth barbell and dumbbells. The second half of the \\nweek (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), when you \\ntrain each muscle group for the second time, use \\nmainly single-joint (isolation) exercises. For exam-\\nple, on chest you will do only fly exercises such as \\ndumbbell flys and cable crossovers.\\nThe multijoint-focused workouts in the first half \\nof the week follow the linear periodized scheme \\nand get heavier each week. However, the sin -\\ngle-joint-focused workouts in the second half of the \\nweek follow a reverse linear periodization scheme \\nand therefore get lighter each week.\\nThere are a few exceptions for obvious reasons. \\nFor starters, there aren't any really useful multijoint \\nexercises for biceps. So the first biceps workout \\neach week you use barbell exercises, such as \\nbarbell curls and barbell preacher curls, while the \\nsecond half of the week you use dumbbell and \\ncable biceps exercises. Another issue is that there \\naren't many single-joint exercises for back, except \\nthe straight-arm pulldown and similar movements. \\nSo the first time you train your back each week, \\nuse rowing exercises, such as the barbell bent-over \\nrow and seated cable row. Then the second time \\nyou train your back that week, use only pulldown \\nexercises as well as the single-joint straight-arm \\npulldown. The other exceptions are abdominals, \\ncalves, and forearms.\\nThe weight workouts also enhance fat burning \\nbecause of the exercise selection and rep ranges. \\nThe multijoint exercises increase the amount of \\ncalories you burn during the workout. The high -\\ner-rep workouts also increase the number of calo-\\nries burned during the workout. The heavy-weight \\nand low-rep workouts, on the other hand, help to \\nboost calorie and fat burn after the workout.\\nThere are two three-week phases to this six-\\nweek program (see table 13.2). In phase 1 you \\nstart with reps in the range of 9 to 11 for the \\nmultijoint-focused training in the first half of week \\n1. For the single-joint-focused work in the second \\nhalf of the week, you do reps in the range of 12 \\nto 15. In week 2 for the multijoint-focused training \\nin the first half of the week, the weight increases \\nto drop the rep range down to 6 to 8 per set. The \\nsecond half of the week when you are doing the \\nsingle-joint-focused work, the weight is reduced to \\nallow reps to increase to 16 to 20 per set. Then \\nin the third and final week of phase 1, weight \\nincreases again to drop reps down to just 2 to 5 \\nper set on the multijoint-focused workouts in the \\nfirst half of the week. And in the second half of \\nthe week during the single-joint-focused workouts, \\nweight decreases again and reps go up to 21 to \\n30 per set.\\nIn phase 2 the cycle repeats again. So in the \\nfirst week, which is week 4 of the program, the \\nweight is reduced to allow the reps to go back to \\n9 to 11 per set during the first half of the week \\nfor the multijoint-focused workouts. And the weight \\nincreases for the single-joint-focused work in the \\nsecond half of the week to bring the reps back \\ndown to 12 to 15 per set. And each week it follows \\njust as in phase 1. However, the major difference \\nin phase 2 is that the majority of exercises are \\ndifferent except for a few of the staple exercises \\nthat are key for strength. Changing up the exer -\\ncises allows you to target slightly different fibers \\nin the muscles for the best overall gains in size.\\nTo enhance fat loss, not to mention aid recovery, \\nthis program uses cardioacceleration in between \\neach set in every workout. If you keep moving from \\nexercise to exercise without taking any rest before \\nor after the cardioacceleration, you can complete \\nmost of these workouts in under an hour. That’s less \\nthan an hour for both weight training and cardio.\\nI’ve also included an intensity technique that I \\ncall cardioaccelerated rest-pause/drop sets. On \\nthe last set of each exercise you take that set \\nto muscle failure. Then you rack the weight and \\n“rest” 15 to 20 seconds. I say “rest” because you \\nwon’t really rest. You will do cardioacceleration by \\nrunning in place for those 15 to 20 seconds. Then \\nyou pick up the weight again and continue doing \\nreps for that exercises until you reach muscle \\nfailure again. But you’re not finished yet. Now you \\nimmediately decrease the weight you are using \\nby 20 to 30 percent and continue doing reps of \\nthat exercise until you reach muscle failure again. \\nNow you are finally finished with that exercise \\nand can move on to the next one. For body-weight \\nexercises, or exercises where the weight is so \\nlight that you cannot do a drop set, you will do \\nShortcut to Shred Program\"),\n",

The first \\nis compound sets, which are supersets that pair \\nexercises for the same muscle group. For each \\nsuperset, one exercise is done with heavy weight \\nfor low reps and the other exercise is done with light \\nweight for high reps. Typically the first exercise in \\nthe first superset pair is heavy weight for low reps. \\nThe first exercise for most muscle groups is typi-\\ncally a multijoint exercise, while the second one is a \\nsingle-joint exercise. Then the second superset pair \\nis typically done in the reverse order: light weight for \\nhigh reps first and the heavy one second. For many \\nmuscle groups, this second exercise pair is done \\nas a preexhaust superset; a single-joint (isolation) \\nexercise is first with lighter weight and a multijoint \\nexercise is next with heavy weight second.\\nEvery two weeks the SS8 program progresses. \\nThe heavy exercises progress in a linear periodized \\nfashion, so they get heavier and you complete \\nfewer reps per set every two weeks. And every two \\nweeks the light exercises progress in a reverse \\nlinear periodized fashion to get lighter and you \\nperform more reps per set. This progression will \\nhelp you get bigger and stronger as well as leaner, \\nbecause it will further boost the calories burned \\nduring and after the workout.\\nAnother change that occurs every two weeks on \\nSS8 is rest between sets. Start off in weeks 1 and \\n2 allowing one minute of rest between supersets. \\nBut every two weeks the rest period drops by 15 \\nseconds. So in weeks 3 and 4 you are allowed 45 \\nseconds of rest, in weeks 5 and 6 you get only 30 \\nseconds of rest, and in weeks 7 and 8 you get 15 \\nseconds of rest, which is basically get no real rest \\nTABLE 13.2 Shortcut to Shred Program (continued)\\n*On the last set do cardioaccelerated rest-pause/drop sets.\\n**Use ankle weights or hold dumbbell between feet if needed.'),\n",

You go back and forth \\nbetween the two exercises with no rest other than \\nthe time it takes to move into that next exercise, \\nwhich is about 15 seconds. You do this until all \\nthree or four supersets are completed. Then you \\nimmediately move into the next superset.\\nThe other addition to this program for maximal \\nfat loss is the use of Tabata HIIT in between muscle \\ngroups. For example, on the chest, shoulders, and \\ntriceps workouts when you finish the last chest \\nsuperset, do Tabata HIIT before you move on to \\nsupersets for shoulders. And after finishing shoul-\\nders, do Tabata HIIT before moving on to triceps. \\nAt the end of the workout, finish with more Tabata \\nHIIT work. For info on Tabatas, see chapter 12.\\nSince the rest periods decrease every two \\nweeks, you cannot use cardioacceleration (see \\nchapter 12) properly with this program. So the \\nnext best thing, or maybe even the better thing, is \\nTabata HIIT in between muscle groups. In weeks \\n1 and 2 do just one Tabata exercise in between \\nmuscle groups for a total time of 12 minutes of \\nTabata per workout. But in week 3 that increases \\nto two exercises done Tabata style between \\nmuscle groups for a total of six exercises and a \\ntotal time of 24 minutes of Tabatas.

German volume training is \\nalso known as 10 × 10 training. You do 10 sets of \\n10 reps. This technique is used in chapter 9 in the \\n5 × 10 program. As the name implies, hundreds \\ntraining involves doing 100-rep sets.\\nWith HIIT 100s you start each workout by doing \\n10 sets of 10 reps for one exercise per muscle \\ngroup. The HIIT comes from the rest periods \\nbetween those 10 sets. Start with just 60 sec -\\nonds of rest between sets and progressively drop \\nit down by 10 seconds over the 6 weeks, until you \\nhave no rest and you're doing 100 reps straight \\nthrough. And that brings us to hundreds training. \\nBy the way, 10 sets of 10 reps is also 100 reps. \\nAnd when you're resting only 10 or 20 seconds \\nbetween sets in the last few weeks of the program, \\nit feels just like you're doing 100 reps straight \\nthrough. Most people are not able to complete all \\n100 reps straight through on HIIT 100s exercises \\nin week 6. Don't worry. If you fail to reach 100 \\nreps, simply rest as many seconds as you have \\nreps left to complete until you hit 100 reps. For \\nexample, if you hit only 70 reps straight through, \\nthen rest 30 seconds and continue.\\nYou start each workout doing one exercise per \\nmuscle group using HIIT 100s. Then follow that by \\ndoing three more sets of the same exercise using \\nyour 10-rep max (a weight that you can normally get \\nfor 10 reps). Of course, after doing 10 sets of 10 \\nreps, you will no longer be able to complete 10 full \\nreps with your 10-rep max weight. You will likely be \\nable to complete only about 5 to 7 reps. On the third \\nset, do a drop set by dropping down to the weight \\nthat you used for HIIT 100s and do as many reps as \\npossible before you reach muscle failure. Then you \\ndo three sets of one or two more exercises for that \\nsame muscle group, depending on the muscle group. \\nRest between all sets after the HIIT 100s exercise \\nwill be only one minute to maximize fat burning.\\nFollow the muscle-group-specific weight training \\nwith a final HIIT 100s using a full-body weight \\nexercise, such as barbell or dumbbell cleans, \\nkettlebell swings, barbell or dumbbell deadlifts, \\nbarbell or dumbbell snatches, one-arm kettlebell \\nor dumbbell snatch, or my unique lift known as the \\ndead curl press.\\nOn the HIIT 100s sets during weeks 1 through \\n3 when rest periods are 30 seconds or more, per-\\nform the first 3 sets of 10 as fast and explosively \\nas possible. This will help to build more muscle \\npower and strength, despite using such light \\nweight. Then for sets 4 through 6, do them slowly \\nand in control, focusing on the contraction with \\neach rep and squeezing each rep at the top for 1 \\nto 2 seconds. This helps to build the mind–muscle \\nconnection, which is critical for muscle size, shape, \\nand separation. During weeks 4 through 6, when \\nrest periods are down at 20 seconds and less, \\nyour goal is to just complete the hundred reps. So \\ndon’t worry about rep speed or control. Just get \\nthe reps done with the best form possible while \\nyour muscles are on fire.\\n \\n*Do these exercises Tabata style.\"),\n",

Don’t worry if you went too heavy. If you \\nfail to complete all 10 sets of 10 reps during the \\nprogram, you can adjust your weight either during \\nthat set or at the next workout. If you can’t com -\\nplete all 10 reps before hitting the eighth set of 10 \\nreps, then immediately drop the weight by 5 or 10 \\npounds before the next set of 10 reps. If you can’t \\ncomplete 10 reps during or after the eighth set, \\nfinish all 10 sets doing as many reps as possible for \\nthose final sets. Then the next time you train that \\nmuscle group, lower the weight by 5 to 10 pounds.\\nIf some of the exercises that you will do HIIT \\n100s with are new to you, then you’ll need to \\nspend some time figuring out how much weight \\nyou can do for 10 reps. The week before you \\nstart the actual HIIT 100s program, work these \\nexercises into your training program to figure out \\nan approximate weight that allows you to perform \\n10 reps but no more. Then when you start the \\nprogram the next week, use half of that weight for \\nyour HIIT 100s sets.\\nWhen trying to estimate your 10-rep max on \\neach exercise, be sure to do the HIIT exercise \\nas the first exercise for that muscle group. For \\nexample, if you don’t know what your 10-rep max \\nis on the bench press, do bench press as the first \\nexercise in your chest workout, aiming for a weight \\nthat allows you to complete just 10 reps. Then \\nfollow with your typical chest routine.\\nWhile the major benefit of this program (see \\ntable 13.4) is rapid fat loss, the fringe benefits \\nare just as impressive. Even though weight is light, \\nmuscle growth will be a pleasant surprise, espe -\\ncially while you are simultaneously dropping body \\nfat. You will have insane growth in muscle groups \\nthat you do not typically train with high volume, \\nlike traps, forearms, and calves. But you may also \\nbe surprised about the muscle growth you get in \\nplaces like your arms and legs. One of the best \\nways to optimize muscle growth is by making a \\ngiven weight more difficult. And HIIT 100s makes \\na very light weight difficult to move. The stress your \\nmuscle receives because of the difficulty in moving \\nthat weight repeatedly is what influences muscle \\ngrowth. This pushes muscle fatigue to new levels, \\nwhich stimulates the production and buildup of \\nbiochemical waste products. These waste products \\nare not a complete waste, since they stimulate \\nthe release of hormones such as growth hormone \\n(GH), which not only boosts muscle size but also \\nencourages fat burning.\\nOf course, another obvious benefit to doing 100 \\nreps with progressively shorter rest periods is an \\nincrease in muscle endurance. This will boost your \\nconditioning for almost any sport. And even if you \\ndo not participate in any sport, this benefit will \\nring loud and clear in your workouts. When you \\ngo back to normal training, where you are resting \\na couple of minutes between sets, your muscle \\nrecovery will be quicker, which means you will be \\nable to get more reps with the same weight than \\nyou normally would on successive sets. That’s \\nbecause progressively dropping your rest periods \\neach week forces your muscles to gradually learn \\nhow to recover more quickly between sets.\\nMost people do not even need to add extra \\nHIIT cardio when following this program.

This way you get the combined benefit \\nof fat loss while actually building some muscle. \\nDoing very high reps with light weight for short \\nperiods can help you blow past plateaus and add \\nsome serious lean muscle.\\nBecause Tabata enhances endurance, it boosts \\nyour body’s ability to burn more fat. And because \\nit enhances explosive energy, the kind you use in \\na typical set of bench presses, it can help you get \\nmore reps with a given weight, or use more weight \\nto get a given number of reps. And that crosses \\nover to more strength as well as more muscle \\ngrowth, since a greater overload on the muscle \\nresults in greater growth.\\nAnd the benefits won’t end there. Because you \\ndo fairly high reps and take very short rest periods \\nbetween sets, you’ll increase the amount of blood \\nvessels that feed your muscle fibers. This will help \\nto get more nutrients, oxygen, and anabolic hor -\\nmones to your muscles, which means they’ll have \\nmore energy during workouts and better recovery \\nand growth after the workout.\\nThis Tabata program will have you doing several \\nexercises per muscle group in Tabata fashion. Do \\n2 to 4 exercises per muscle group. Each exercise \\nconsists of 8 sets of 20 seconds, getting as many \\nreps as possible in those 20 seconds. Rest only \\n10 seconds between the 20-second sets. Once \\nyou’ve completed 8 sets, rest 1 to 2 minutes and \\nthen do the same on the next exercise.\\nFinish each workout with four full-body or \\ncalisthenic exercises done in Tabata fashion for \\neven more fat burning. When you do these four \\nexercises, take no scheduled rest between the \\nexercises. Once you have completed all eight \\ncycles of one exercise, move into the next one as \\nquickly as possible.\\nIt will take some trial and error to select the \\nproper weight for each exercise. I suggest you \\nstart very light because you can work up in weight \\neach week.

The deltoid muscles are divided \\ninto the front (anterior) head, middle (lateral) head, \\nand rear (posterior) head. (See the diagram.) \\nAlthough many of these exercises are pressing \\nmovements (such as the barbell overhead press) \\nthat are multijoint exercises, requiring the use \\nof the trapezius and the triceps as well as the \\ndeltoids, they are considered primarily shoulder \\nexercises because of the movement of the upper \\narms overhead. The shoulder exercises are divided \\ninto pressing exercises, upright row exercises, \\nand raises. There are also rotator cuff exercises \\nat the end for keeping your shoulder stabilizers \\nstrong and preventing injury, which is an all-too-\\ncommon problem among weightlifters with weak \\nrotator cuff muscles. The pressing exercises are \\nfurther divided into barbell overhead pressing exer-\\ncises; dumbbell overhead pressing exercises; and \\nmachine, band, and body-weight overhead pressing \\nexercises. The upright row exercises are further \\ndivided into barbell upright row exercises, Smith \\nmachine upright row exercises, dumbbell upright \\nrow exercises, cable upright row exercises, and \\nband upright row exercises. The raises are further \\ndivided into front raise exercises, lateral raise \\nexercises, and rear deltoid exercises. Wherever a \\ncertain type of exercise is used in a workout, any \\none of the same type can be substituted.\\nFront\\nhead\\nMiddle\\nhead\\nRear\\nhead'),\n",

After all, building muscle mass \\nand muscle strength go hand in hand to some \\ndegree. So nutrient requirements and timing are \\nvery similar whether you are trying to maximize \\nmuscle hypertrophy or muscle strength. And more \\noften than not, you are trying to do both at the \\nsame time.\\nAs mentioned in the introduction to this part, \\nthere is not enough room in this book to provide \\nyou with all the nutrition basics you will need to \\nunderstand. However, the guidelines here will serve \\nyou well in meeting your goals.\\nThese guidelines are what I have found to be \\nmost effective over decades of working with people \\nto maximize muscle growth and strength naturally. \\nThey are backed by science done in the lab, but \\nmore important they are backed by real-world \\nevidence in the gym on literally millions of people \\nusing them over the years. I’ve divided the guide-\\nlines into 10 goals to focus on with your diet. After \\nthe goals are sample meal plans based on the \\ngoals; you will discover how to incorporate these \\nplans into your day based on when you work out.\\nGOAL 1: FOCUS ON PROTEIN\\nMuscle is made of protein. To build muscle, you \\nneed to boost muscle protein synthesis as well as \\ndecrease muscle breakdown. Research in the lab \\nand the gym confirms that the best way to do this \\nis with a diet that gets you a minimum of 1 gram \\nper pound of body weight (a little over 2 grams \\nof protein per kilogram of body weight) and even \\ncloser to about 1.5 grams of protein per pound of \\nbody weight (about 3 grams of protein per kilogram \\nof body weight) per day. This is especially true for \\nthose following more intense training programs.\\nSeveral studies support the notion that getting \\nup to 1.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight \\nis effective for producing better gains in muscle \\nmass. Victoria University (Australia) researchers \\nhad weight-trained men consume about 1.5 grams \\nof protein per pound of body weight per day or \\n0.75 gram of protein per pound during an 11-week \\nweight training program (Cribb et al. 2007). The \\nhigher protein intake was achieved by supplement-\\ning with whey protein. The men who ingested the \\nhigher protein gained significantly greater strength \\nand muscle fiber protein in the quadriceps than \\nthe control group did. In a 2006 study by Candow \\nand colleagues, male and female participants sup-\\nplemented with either whey protein or soy protein \\nto bump up their daily protein intake to about 1.5 \\ngrams per pound of body weight per day during 6 \\nweeks of weight training. The control group con -\\nsumed about 0.75 gram of protein per pound. The \\nparticipants getting the greater protein, regardless \\nof the source, had significantly greater gains in \\nmuscle strength and growth. And in a study by \\nBurke and colleagues (2001), participants’ protein \\nintake was increased to 1.5 grams per pound of \\nbody weight per day during 6 weeks of weight train-\\ning with whey protein, while control participants \\nconsumed 0.5 gram of protein per pound. At the \\nend of the six weeks the participants getting the \\nextra protein gained significantly more strength \\nand muscle mass. A 2011 study by Witard and \\ncolleagues has also shown that even in endurance \\nathletes, when they double their protein intake \\nto close to 1.5 grams per pound of body weight \\nper day when training intensity is increased, they \\nrecover better and maintain better performance.'),\n",

Many studies do not show a benefit of \\nincreased protein intake because protein intake \\nwas not increased enough from their baseline \\ndiets or protein intake was not increased enough \\ncompared to the lower-protein group. However, \\nwhen you look at studies that increase protein \\nintake by almost double the participants’ base -\\nline intake or increase protein intake by at least \\n50 percent of that consumed by the lower-protein \\ngroup or control group, then high protein intake \\ndoes lead to significant gains in lean muscle mass \\nand muscle strength.\\nThe bottom line is that eating a higher-protein \\ndiet is effective for gaining more muscle and \\nincreasing muscle strength. Shoot for 1 to 1.5 \\ngrams of protein per pound of body weight for \\noptimal results.\\nGOAL 2: GET AMPLE FAT\\nMany people still are misguided when it comes \\nto dietary fat. There is still a tendency to believe \\nthat you must keep fat low to be fit and healthy. \\nYet nothing could be further from the truth. Fat is \\nan important macronutrient for anyone interested \\nin building muscle and gaining strength as well as \\noptimizing health.\\nOne reason you need to take in adequate fat is \\nthat your body needs certain types of fat, such as \\nomega-3 fat (from fatty fish like salmon). This type \\nof fat has recently been found to be a critical player \\nin muscle recovery and growth. It also keeps body \\nfat at bay, aids joint health, protects from heart \\ndisease, and boosts brain function, among other \\nbenefits. A study by Smith and colleagues (2011) \\nsuggests that those supplementing with fish oil \\nhave a higher anabolic response (higher rates \\nof muscle protein synthesis) when consuming \\nprotein, which can lead to greater muscle growth \\nin the long run.\\nThen there is monounsaturated fat. This is not \\nan essential fat, but it is a healthy fat because it \\nprovides numerous health benefits and is readily \\nburned for fuel rather than stored as body fat. \\nOn top of that, male athletes consuming more \\nmonounsaturated fat maintain higher testosterone \\nlevels (Hamalainen et al. 1983; Reed et al. 1987). \\nActually, male athletes consuming more mono -\\nunsaturated fat \\nand saturated fat maintain higher \\ntestosterone levels. So, yes, you actually should try \\nto consume some saturated fat rather than try to \\navoid it at all costs. Good sources are beef, dairy \\n(full fat or reduced fat, but not fat-free), and whole \\neggs. The only fat that you want to avoid is trans \\nfat. The Malmo Diet and Cancer Study reported \\nthat individuals receiving more than 30 percent of \\ntheir total daily energy from fat and more than 10 \\npercent from saturated fat did not have increased \\nmortality (Leosdottir et al. 2005).\\nA simple rule for fat intake is to consume \\nhalf your body weight in pounds (or about your \\nentire body weight in kilograms) in grams of fat. \\nSo, if you weigh 200 pounds (90 kg), you would \\nconsume about 100 grams of fat per day, 33 per-\\ncent of it as monounsaturated fat, 33 percent as \\npolyunsaturated fat (mainly omega-3 fat), and 33 \\npercent as saturated fat each day. Also consider \\nsupplementing with 4 to 10 grams of fish oil per \\nday. If you really want to fine-tune this recommen-\\ndation, look to see how much DHA (docosahexae-\\nnoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) your \\nfish oil provides per capsule and try to get close \\nto 1500 milligrams DHA and 1800 milligrams of \\nEPA per day for maximal benefits.\\nGOAL 3: MANIPULATE \\nCARBOHYDRATE\\nBecause you want to make sure you’re eating \\nample protein and ample fat for maximizing muscle \\ngrowth, the amounts of these two critical macro -\\nnutrients should stay about the same regardless \\nof where you are in your diet or your goals. That \\nmeans to gain more mass or to lose more fat you \\nshould change your carb intake. The body can'),\n",

So there is no essential carbohy-\\ndrate you need from your diet. Unlike with essential \\nfat you need to consume, and with protein there \\nare essential amino acids you need to consume \\nbecause the body doesn’t make them.\\nFor maximizing muscle growth and strength \\ngains while minimizing fat gains, start off some -\\nwhere around 1.5 to 2.0 grams of carbohydrate per \\npound of body weight. Then you can either increase \\nthis amount if you find that you are not gaining \\nmass rapidly enough and are not gaining any body \\nfat. Similarly, you can also gradually lower this \\namount if you find that you are gaining too much \\nbody fat. Everyone’s body is different, and your \\nbody will respond to carbohydrate differently. So \\nyou need to experiment with carbohydrate intake.\\nGOAL 4: COUNT CALORIES\\nCalorie intake is important for building muscle \\nand strength because you need to be in a positive \\nenergy balance (consuming more calories than \\nyou are burning) to truly maximize muscle growth. \\nHowever, if you are hitting the proper amount of \\nprotein and fat and have your carb intake dialed \\nin for your body, then how far over your energy \\nneeds or under you are doesn’t really matter . . \\n. to a point. As stated in rule 3, it is possible to \\ngain muscle while losing body fat. That being said, \\nto maximize muscle mass, you should be eating \\nmore calories than you are burning each day. And \\nto maximize fat loss, you should be burning more \\ncalories than you are consuming. However, it is \\npossible to burn slightly more calories than you are \\nconsuming yet gain muscle because you are eating \\nample amounts of protein and fat. We know that 1 \\ngram of protein provides 4 calories, as does 1 gram \\nof carbs. We also know that 1 gram of fat provides \\nabout 9 calories (8 to 10 calories, depending on \\nthe type of fat). If you build a diet from the mac -\\nronutrients up and want to be sure to get in 1.5 \\ngrams of protein per pound of body weight and 0.5 \\ngram of fat per pound of body weight, then that \\nis about 11 calories per pound of body weight. If \\nyou shoot for about 1 to 2 grams of carbohydrate \\nper pound of body weight, then you know that you \\nshould be eating at least 15 calories per pound of \\nbody weight to build muscle. If you find you need a \\ngood 3 grams of carbohydrate per pound of body \\nweight, then you need about 23 calories per pound.\\nGOAL 5: EAT FREQUENTLY\\nIt makes sense that if you’re trying to eat ample \\namounts of protein, fat, carbohydrate, and total \\ncalories every day, then a smart strategy is to eat \\nfrequent meals throughout the day. Decades of \\nexperience show that bodybuilders who eat more \\nfrequent meals build more muscle. Just about \\nevery top-level professional bodybuilder consumes \\na meal every couple of hours. These are men who \\ncarry the most muscle mass in the world. And on \\nthe other end of the spectrum, newborn infants, \\nthe smallest humans in the world, eat every 2 to \\n3 hours during the first few months of life when it \\nis absolutely critical that they rapidly gain mass.\\nAll this anecdotal evidence is interesting; how-\\never, clinical research also supports this notion \\nthat more frequent meals better promote muscle \\ngrowth. In a study by Moore and colleagues (2012), \\nparticipants performed a leg workout and then ate \\na total of 80 grams of whey protein over the next \\n12 hours in three methods. They consumed eight \\n10-gram doses of whey protein every 1.5 hours, \\nor consumed four 20-gram doses of whey every 3 \\nhours, or consumed two 40-gram doses of whey \\nevery 6 hours. The researchers reported that pro-\\ntein net balance, which is essentially muscle pro-\\ntein synthesis minus muscle protein breakdown, \\nwas significantly greater when they consumed the \\nfour 20-gram doses of whey protein every 3 hours \\nas compared to the other two dosing strategies. \\nGreater protein net balance essentially means \\nmore muscle growth.\\nThere are a couple of take-home points from this \\nstudy. The first has to do with amounts of protein. \\nThat the 10-gram doses of whey every 1.5 hours \\ndid not lead to greater protein net balance than the \\n20-gram doses every 3 hours is more a message \\nabout protein quantity than frequency. So you need \\nto get an adequate dose of protein at each meal, \\nand the minimum appears to be 20 grams. They \\ndidn’t look at higher doses taken more frequently, \\nbut I would suggest shooting for 20 to 40 grams \\nof protein per meal depending on the source.\\nThe second take-home point of the study is that, \\nto maximize muscle growth, you should not go much \\nlonger than 3 hours between meals. Any longer than \\nthis appears to increase protein breakdown too \\nmuch so that any major boost in protein synthesis \\nyou get is just making up for the breakdown and \\nnot maximizing the potential for muscle growth.

But \\nusing a protein powder isn’t just convenient; it also \\nprovides direct benefits for muscle growth, if you \\nuse the right kind.\\nFor the best protein powder, you definitely want \\nto have some form of whey protein. Whey protein \\nis a milk protein. Milk contains two primary types \\nof protein: whey and casein. Whey is the soluble \\nportion of milk protein, making up 20 percent of \\nthe protein, while casein is the globular portion \\nand makes up the remaining 80 percent. So whey \\nstarts out as whole milk from cows. The whey is \\nseparated from the casein in the cheese manu -\\nfacturing process. It’s literally drained off and sent \\non its way to processing for whey protein. It then \\nundergoes a variety of filtering steps to remove a \\ngood deal of the carbohydrate (lactose) and fat and \\ntake the whey from being about 15 percent protein \\nto 35 percent protein, then to 50 percent protein, \\nand then to 80 percent protein concentrate. These \\nare all considered whey protein concentrates; the \\n80 percent protein is the one most commonly used \\nin protein powders using whey protein concentrate. \\nThe gentle filtration process that produces whey \\nprotein concentrate leaves the whey protein microf-\\nractions in place. These include beta-lactoglobulin \\n(~50-55%), alpha-lactalbumin (~20-25%), glyco -\\nmacropeptide (~10-15%), immunoglobulins (~10-\\n15%), serum albumin (~5-10%), lactoferrin (~1%), \\nlactoperoxidase (<1%), and other minor proteins \\nsuch as beta-microglobulin, lysozyme, insulin-like \\ngrowth factors (IGFs), and gamma-globulins, which \\nprovide the major benefits of whey, such as anti-\\noxidant and immune-boosting benefits, as well as \\nenhance muscle growth and strength.\\nTo further purify the whey protein and create a \\nwhey protein isolate that is greater than 90 percent \\nprotein, the 80 percent whey protein concentrate \\nundergoes a further process, often involving \\nmicrofiltration or ion exchange chromatography to \\nremove more of the carbohydrate and fat. Depend-\\ning on the processing involved, creating an isolate \\nsometimes damages the microfractions of whey. \\nSo there can be a cost of a purer whey protein \\npowder. This is the reason my whey protein isolate \\nundergoes microfiltration and ultrafiltration, which \\npreserves the important whey microfractions, is \\nsought after. Some whey protein also undergoes \\nthe process of hydrolysis. This essentially breaks \\nthe long whey protein chains into much shorter \\nchains, or peptides; some are just two or three \\namino acids in length. These hydrolyzed whey \\nproteins are even quicker to digest than whey \\nisolate. The whey protein concentrate, isolate, or \\nhydrolysate is then spray-dried to form a powder. \\nThe powder is often instantized so that it mixes \\nbetter in fluids and does not clump.\\nWhey is definitely the king of the protein pow -\\nders. This is due to several factors. The first is \\nthat it is rich in the branched-chain amino acids \\n(BCAAs), which are the most critical for muscle \\ngrowth, as well as energy. For more on BCAAs, \\nread goal 8 later in this chapter. No other protein \\nis as fast as whey protein, meaning that it gets \\nits amino acids into the bloodstream quite rapidly. \\nWhey delivers the majority of its amino acids to \\nthe bloodstream in about 60 to 90 minutes (figure \\n27.1; Boirie 1997). This allows it to rapidly turn \\non muscle protein synthesis for instigating muscle \\ngrowth. This is important around workouts to \\nenhance recovery and aid muscle growth while \\nthe muscle is primed for it. Whey protein also \\nprovides special peptides and microfractions that \\nother protein sources or straight-up amino acids \\ndon’t. These peptides and microfractions provide \\nnumerous benefits to health, performance, and \\nphysique. For example, some peptides relax the \\nblood vessels to cause vasodilation. Not only does \\nthis provide cardiovascular health benefits, but it \\nhelps to deliver whey’s amino acids to the muscles \\nin a more efficient manner. A study comparing whey \\nprotein to an amino acid mix that provided the \\nsame amino acids that whey provides showed that \\nwhey protein increased muscle protein synthesis \\nbetter than the amino acids (Kanda et al. 2013).\\nYet as good as whey is at rapidly spiking muscle \\nprotein synthesis, by itself, it may offer too tran -\\nsient a boost in protein synthesis. Combining \\ncasein protein (which is very slow digesting) with \\nwhey prolongs the length of time that muscle pro-\\ntein is spiked and leads to better long-term gains \\nin muscle growth and strength, as compared to \\nwhey protein alone (Soop et al. 2012; Reidy et al. \\n2014; Reidy et al. 2013; Kerksick 2006).'),\n",

You can do this \\nby buying a separate jug of whey protein and a \\nseparate jug of casein protein and mixing them \\nat about 1:1 ratio. Or you can go for the more \\nconvenient method of buying a protein powder \\nblend that already combines whey and casein. An \\neven easier method is to mix whey protein in about \\n2 cups of low-fat milk or 1 cup of Greek yogurt. \\nBoth milk and Greek yogurt are good sources of \\nmicellar casein and can make the protein powder \\nmuch tastier than mixing it in water.\\nThe most critical times to take this protein blend \\nare within 30 minutes before workouts and within \\n30 minutes after workouts. Shoot for about 20 to \\n40 grams of protein at each dose.\\nAnother crucial time to take a mixed protein \\npowder is as soon as you wake up in the morning. \\nBecause you have been fasting while you sleep, \\nyour muscle protein has been broken down for \\nfuel. By drinking a mixed protein shake of whey \\nand casein, you rebuild the broken-down protein \\nand put your body back in an anabolic state.\\nYou should also have a mixed protein powder \\ncontaining whey and casein immediately before \\nbed. Micellar casein can take up to 7 hours to \\nfully digest. This is because casein literally forms \\na clot when it is in the stomach. To visualize this, \\nconsider when you mix a whey protein powder com-\\npared to when you mix a casein protein powder. \\nThe whey tends to mix very easily yet the casein \\ntends to form clumps in the fluid. This is similar to \\nwhat happens in your stomach when you consume \\ncasein. Although the clumps of casein may be \\nbad for palatability when drinking a casein shake, \\nit provides benefits when these clumps form in \\nyour stomach. These clumps decrease the surface \\narea of the casein that is available to digestive \\nenzymes. The enzymes must digest the casein \\nclumps one layer at a time, much like peeling the \\nlayers of an onion. This means that casein provides \\na slow and steady supply of amino acids for most \\nof the night. That can help to prevent the break -\\ndown of muscle protein while you sleep, helping \\nyou to gain more muscle mass in the long run.\\nGOAL 7: USE DIFFERENT TYPES \\nOF CARBOHYDRATE BEFORE \\nAND AFTER WORKOUTS\\nIt should be obvious that before a workout you \\nwant to provide your body ample fuel to keep your \\nmuscles running as strong as possible for as \\nlong as possible throughout the workout. Having \\na protein shake, as discussed earlier, will help \\nwith those energy needs, as will the supplements \\ndiscussed in goal 8. However, during your workouts \\none of the major fuel sources that your muscles \\nuse is glycogen. Glycogen is the storage form of \\ncarbohydrate. In simplified terms, when you con -\\nsume carbohydrate, most is broken down into or \\nconverted into glucose, which is what blood sugar \\nis. Glucose can either be used fairly immediately \\nfor fuel or it can be stored, mainly in muscle fibers \\nand the liver. It is stored in the form of glycogen, \\nwhich is just long branched chains of glucose \\nconnected together. The glycogen in your muscle \\ncells and liver is broken down into glucose and \\nused as one of the main fuels for your workouts.\\n*    *\\n*\\n500\\n400\\n300\\n200\\n100\\n0\\nTime 0 hr 1 hr 2 hr 3 hr 4 hr 5 hr 6 hr 7 hr\\nA\\nLeucine concentration\\n(μM)\\nFIGURE 27.1 Plasma leucine concentrations after ingestion of whey or casein.\\nReprinted, by permission, from Y .

The best source of such a carb \\nis a low-glycemic carb. Fruit works well because it \\nis a low-glycemic carb and because most fruit is \\nabout half glucose and half fructose. \\nLow glycemic \\nmeans that it doesn’t spike blood glucose levels, \\nwhich then spikes insulin levels. Because when \\ninsulin levels are spiked, it rushes all of the glu -\\ncose into the muscle cells and depletes the levels \\nof glucose in the blood, which puts you in a state \\nof hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). That leaves you \\nlethargic, fatigued, slow, and weak. So when you \\nconsume fruit before a workout, the glucose com-\\nponent of fruit will give your body a small source \\nof quick energy that it can use. But the fructose, \\non the other hand, is low glycemic despite being \\na sugar. This is because the body can’t readily \\nuse the form of sugar that fructose is. So it has \\nto go to the liver, where it gets converted to gly -\\ncogen. Then the liver controls when the glycogen \\nis released into the bloodstream as glucose. This \\nallows fructose to provide longer-lasting energy. \\nSo with fruit you get a small dose of quick energy, \\nbut also longer lasting energy to prevent you from \\ncrashing. Within 30 minutes before workouts con-\\nsume about 20 to 40 grams of carbohydrate from \\nfruit or other low-glycemic carb source along with \\na protein shake.\\nAfter the workout, your best bet is to do the \\nopposite of before the workout and consume a \\nhigh-glycemic carb. At the end of a workout, your \\nmuscle glycogen levels are depleted. If your muscle \\nglycogen levels are not restored, your performance \\nin the next workout can suffer and muscle growth \\nmay be compromised.\\nOne way that muscle growth can be compro -\\nmised is because muscle glycogen levels serve \\nas a barometer for how much energy the body \\nhas stored. If energy levels are low, as it seems \\nwhen muscle glycogen is low, then the muscles \\nmay not want to expend energy-building muscle. \\nBuilding muscle requires energy, and bigger mus-\\ncles require more energy to maintain. If your body \\nis unsure that you have adequate energy to fuel \\nother, more critical processes and to maintain \\nmore muscle mass, it may choose not to go gang-\\nbusters in building muscle.\\nAnother way that muscle growth may be compro-\\nmised by not consuming adequate carbohydrate \\nis because glycogen pulls water into the muscle \\nfibers. The more glycogen, the more water in the \\nmuscle fibers. More water makes the muscles \\nfuller. This makes your muscles appear signifi -\\ncantly bigger. If your muscles are low in glycogen, \\nthen they are also low in water and that means \\nthat they look flatter and smaller than they could. \\nHaving muscles that are fuller due to more glyco-\\ngen and water can also instigate muscle growth. \\nThere is evidence that having more water in the \\nmuscle fibers stretches the muscle membranes, \\nand that stretch instigates chemical pathways that \\nincrease muscle protein synthesis, which can lead \\nto greater muscle growth.\\nThe best way to fully replenish muscle glycogen \\nafter workouts is with high-glycemic (fast-digest -\\ning) carbohydrate. These types of carbohydrate \\nmake it into the bloodstream and to your muscle \\nfibers almost as quickly as you ingest them. The \\nquicker you get carbohydrate to your muscles \\nafter workouts, the faster and better the muscle \\nglycogen replenishment. One of the best sources \\nof fast carbohydrate is dextrose, which is glucose. \\nThis form of sugar requires no digestion and is \\nabsorbed immediately into your bloodstream. \\nYou can use straight dextrose or glucose powder \\nor Pixy Stix (100% dextrose) or gummy bears, \\nwhich tend to be made out of dextrose and corn \\nsyrup. Corn syrup is essentially branched glucose \\nmolecules that are immediately broken down and \\nabsorbed. Corn syrup is completely different from \\nhigh-fructose corn syrup. White bread and white \\npotatoes are also good sources because they \\nare mainly starch, which is branched glucose \\nmolecules bound together that break apart rapidly \\nupon ingestion.\\nThese fast carbs also spike insulin levels. After \\na workout is the one of the rare times of day when \\nyou want to spike the anabolic hormone insulin. \\nInsulin is critical for pushing creatine into muscle \\nfibers. Without a big spike in insulin, creatine \\nuptake is not optimal. Insulin also helps amino \\nacids, such as beta-alanine and BCAAs; the other \\ncritical ones from your protein shake get taken up \\nby the muscle fibers. And let’s not forget about \\nthe glucose from fast carbohydrate, which insulin \\nhelps to gain entry into the muscle fibers. For more \\ninformation on these supplements, see goal 8.\\nHaving fast carbohydrate after workouts is a \\nsweet treat that doesn’t damage your diet. Whether \\nyou are trying to maximize gains in mass or lose fat \\nand gain muscle, you should be following a fairly \\n“clean” diet. That is, doughnuts, French fries, and'),\n",

Having a dose of sweets in the form of dex-\\ntrose, gummy bears, Pixy Stix, or white bread with \\njelly is a great way to get your sweet fix in for the \\nday and actually have it enhance your results. Why \\nwould you ever want to skip that?\\nSome research shows that consuming a protein \\nshake after workouts with or without fast carbs \\nspikes muscle protein synthesis to an equivalent \\nlevel. In other words, adding carbohydrate to a \\nprotein shake postworkout does not increase \\nmuscle protein synthesis any more than the pro -\\ntein shake did alone without carbohydrate. This \\nhas caused some experts to claim that you do not \\nneed carbohydrate after workouts. Well, that’s a bit \\nextreme. It’s true that you can still build muscle \\nwithout having carbohydrate after workouts. But I \\nwouldn’t recommend that unless you are on a very \\nlow-carb diet and you have removed carbohydrate \\nfrom every other meal of your diet. In fact, it makes \\nno sense to eat carbohydrate at other meals but \\navoid eating carbohydrate postworkout. If you are \\neating carbohydrate at any meals, the most critical \\nmeal to eat it is the postworkout meal when it will \\naid in recovery.\\nSome people worry that eating carbohydrate \\npostworkout will blunt growth hormone and tes -\\ntosterone levels after the workout. Here’s what \\nthey don’t understand. Growth hormone and \\ntestosterone levels rise during the workout and \\npeak toward the end of the workout, depending \\non the workout. After the workout, the levels of \\ntheses hormones begin to drop sharply so that \\nthey are back to resting levels about 60 to 90 \\nminutes after the workout is over. The release of \\nthese hormones has already peaked before you \\nconsume the carbohydrate. After the workout it is \\ntoo late for the carbohydrate to have a negative \\neffect on hormone levels.\\nSome people worry that consuming fast carbo-\\nhydrate after workouts will lead to diabetes. This \\nis due to the media’s demonization of all sugar. \\nYes, if you are eating sugar while sitting around \\nall day, it will increase your risk of developing type \\n2 diabetes. But someone who trains regularly is \\nalready preventing the metabolic damage that \\nleads to type 2 diabetes. And right after a work -\\nout is when the carbohydrate goes straight to the \\nmuscles and restocks the muscle glycogen as well \\nas the liver glycogen levels. So there is no risk in \\nconsuming fast carbohydrate after workouts. It’s \\nwhat your body needs.\\nAlthough the amount of fast carbohydrate you \\nconsume after a workout depends on your weight \\nand the intensity and length of the workout, a \\ngeneral recommendation is to shoot for about 20 \\nto 40 grams of fast carbs such as dextrose within \\n30 minutes after the workout is over. Limit the fast \\ncarbs to about 60 grams for two main reasons. The \\nfirst is that for optimal absorption by the intestines, \\n60 to 70 grams of one type of carbohydrate is \\nthe maximum before absorption by the intestines \\nbecomes limited. If you’re consuming more than \\nthis, add some fructose, such as from fruit, to your \\npostworkout meal in addition to the dextrose or \\nglucose. The second reason is that consuming too \\nmuch fast carbohydrate can make you feel terrible \\nafter it’s all been quickly taken up by the liver and \\nmuscles and your blood glucose levels drop. This \\nis known as hypoglycemia and can make you feel \\ndizzy, lethargic, and just lousy in general. If you find \\nthat this happens to you even with smaller amounts \\nof fast carbohydrate, then mix your postworkout \\ncarbohydrate so that you are getting some fast \\nand some slow carbohydrate, such as fruit, oats, \\nwhole-wheat bread, and sweet potatoes.\\nGOAL 8: SUPPLEMENT BEFORE \\nAND AFTER WORKOUTS\\nThe two most critical windows for supplying your \\nbody the nutrients it needs to grow bigger and \\nstronger is the preworkout window and the post -\\nworkout window. Getting the right nutrients right \\nbefore you work out can have a significant impact \\non your muscle strength, energy levels, muscle \\nendurance, and overall intensity of your training. \\nPlus it will prime your body for muscle growth when \\nthe workout is over.\\nTaking in the proper nutrients immediately after \\nthe workout will help to better replenish what was \\nused up during the workout, aid recovery, and allow \\nfor better muscle growth and strength gains.\\nIn addition to protein powder blend and carbo-\\nhydrate before and after workouts, the three criti-\\ncal supplements that you should consider taking \\nbefore and after workouts are BCAAs, creatine, \\nand beta-alanine. Along with the protein and car -\\nbohydrate, these can have a dramatic impact on \\nmuscle growth and strength gains.

They also lost \\nbody fat while taking the supplements pre- and \\npostworkout, while the group taking the supple -\\nments in the morning and night lost no body fat. \\nThe pre- and postworkout supplement group also \\nhad significantly higher muscle glycogen levels, \\nwhich is critical for performance and muscle growth.\\nbranched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)—The BCAAs \\nare the three amino acids leucine, isoleucine, \\nand valine. These amino acids are critical to take \\nbefore and after workouts because of their ability \\nto boost energy, reduce fatigue, and instigate \\nmuscle growth.\\nSupplementing with BCAAs before exercise \\npromotes muscle endurance and blunts fatigue. \\nOne reason for this is the fact that the BCAAs, \\nunlike most other amino acids, are used directly \\nby the muscle fibers as an energy source. This is \\nespecially true during intense exercise, such as \\nweight training.\\nAnother way the BCAAs keep you energized \\nduring workouts is thanks to valine. During exer -\\ncise tryptophan is taken up by the brain in large \\namounts. Tryptophan is converted in the brain to \\n5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), or what you likely know \\nbetter as serotonin. Having higher serotonin during \\nexercise signals the brain that the body is fatigued. \\nThis leads to a reduction in muscle strength and \\nendurance. Valine competes with tryptophan for \\nentry into the brain and typically wins. This means \\nthat less tryptophan gets in and gets converted to \\nserotonin, which allows your muscles to contract \\nwith more force for a longer time before getting \\nfatigued. This also can help you to stay more alert \\nand keep your brain sharper during the day when \\nyou are not exercising.\\nAfter workouts you want another dose of BCAAs \\nbecause they are the most critical amino acids for \\nmuscle growth. Leucine is the key player here; it \\nhas one of the most critical roles in muscle growth. \\nLeucine acts much like a key does to an ignition \\nof a car. The car in this case is a muscle cell or \\nfiber. The ignition turns on the process of muscle \\nprotein synthesis, which builds up the muscle \\nprotein that leads to muscle growth. In more sci -\\nentific terms, leucine activates a complex called \\nmTOR, which ramps up muscle protein synthesis \\nand therefore muscle growth. Those who add extra \\nleucine to postworkout protein and carbohydrate \\nhave significantly greater muscle protein synthesis \\nthan those just getting protein and carbohydrate.\\nAnother way that leucine acts as a potent ana-\\nbolic agent is by spiking insulin levels. Much like \\neating high-glycemic carbs, leucine increases the \\nrelease of insulin from the pancreas, which helps \\nto drive it into the muscle cells where it can work \\nto stimulate muscle growth. Insulin also encour -\\nages muscles’ growth itself by encouraging greater \\nmuscle protein synthesis and decreasing muscle \\nprotein breakdown.\\nTake a 5- to 10-gram dose of BCAAs within 30 \\nminutes before workouts and another 5 to 10 \\ngrams of BCAAs within 30 minutes after workouts. \\nEven though whey protein, which you will also take \\nat these points, is rich in BCAAs, taking extra \\nBCAAs in their free form can get them to your \\nmuscles faster and ensure that you have ample \\nBCAAs at the time they are most critical.\\ncreatine—Both clinical data and anecdotal evi -\\ndence suggest that creatine provides the best \\nresults when taken before and after workouts. \\nThe main reason to get a dose of creatine before \\nworkouts is that it provides the muscle fibers with \\na powerful energy source. Once inside the muscle \\nfibers, creatine gains a high-energy phosphate to \\nform phosphocreatine (PCr). Phosphocreatine is \\nsimply a molecule of creatine with a phosphate \\ngroup attached to it. During very high-intensity \\nexercise, such as weightlifting, creatine donates \\nthis high-energy phosphate group to the muscle \\nto form ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This rap-\\nidly generated ATP fuels the muscle contractions \\nduring a set. The more phosphocreatine you have \\nstored in your muscle fibers, the more reps you \\ncan get during a set. This is the main way that \\nsupplementing with creatine leads to greater \\ngains in muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy \\nover time. It allows you to complete more reps \\nwith a given weight. That eventually allows you to \\nlift heavier and heavier weight. And that greater \\noverload placed on the muscle in combination \\nwith greater work performed eventually leads to \\ngreater muscle growth. Getting a dose of creatine \\nbefore workouts ensures that your levels of phos-\\nphocreatine in the muscle fibers are maximized.\\nSupplementing with creatine leads to significant \\ngains in muscle strength and power as well as \\nmuscle growth.

A \\n2003 review by Rawson and Volek on creatine \\nreported that out of 16 studies investigating the \\neffects of creatine on one-rep max strength, the \\naverage increase in strength was about 10 per -\\ncent more in those taking creatine than in those \\ntaking a placebo.\\nStudies also show that creatine enables people \\nto complete more reps with a given weight. Com-\\npetitive powerlifters taking creatine while preparing \\nfor a competition increased the number of reps \\nthey were able to complete with 85 percent of \\ntheir one-rep max by 40 percent, while those taking \\na placebo had no change in the number of reps \\nthey were able to complete with the same weight \\n(Kelly and Jenkins, 1998). Rawson and Volek \\n(2003) determined that out of the 16 studies they \\nreviewed, the average increase in reps performed \\nwhile taking creatine was about 15 percent more \\nthan for those taking a placebo. Figure 27.2 shows \\nthe average percent increase in muscle strength \\nand repetitions completed when participants sup-\\nplemented with creatine as compared to a placebo.\\nMost of the studies performed on creatine \\nindicate that supplementing with it significantly \\nenhances athletic ability because it produces \\nhigher muscle force and power during short bouts \\nof exercise. The participants in these studies had \\nmixed athletic ability and training status, from rela-\\ntively untrained novices to competitive college-level \\nathletes. Some of the exercise performances that \\nare improved include various types of short-term \\nand all-out cycling, sprinting, repeated jumping, \\nswimming, soccer, kayaking, rowing, and of course \\nweightlifting, which was discussed previously. The \\ngreatest improvements in athletic performance \\nseem to be found during a series of repetitive high-\\npower output exercise bouts. For example, after \\na short rest period (20-60 seconds) after a short \\nsprint, speed may be increased on the second bout \\nof sprinting. Athletic performance during these \\nlatter bouts of exercise can be increased by 5 to \\n20 percent with creatine over the placebo group. \\nThis means that athletes in sports such as football \\nand soccer, in which continuous play typically lasts \\nfor only a few seconds, can expect a significant \\nboost in performance from creatine.\\nSeveral studies show that creatine significantly \\nboosts lean muscle mass.

Becque and colleagues \\n(2000) reported that trained weightlifters taking \\ncreatine gained almost 5 pounds of lean body \\nweight in 6 weeks, while those taking a placebo \\nhad no change in body weight. Since creatine sup-\\nplementation likely does not increase bone mass \\nor organ mass, the increase in lean body weight \\nis more reasonably the result of a gain in muscle \\nmass. In these short periods a good deal of that \\ngain in muscle mass likely comes from water, \\nbecause the muscle fibers gain a higher volume of \\nfluid when stocked with higher levels of creatine. \\nHowever, that can lead to long-term muscle growth \\nvia greater protein synthesis. Figure 27.3 shows \\nthe average increase in lean body weight (muscle \\nmass) in pounds that participants gained while \\ntaking creatine and following a weight training \\nprogram. Both studies found no change in lean \\nbody weight in those taking a placebo.\\nThe majority of benefits from creatine involve \\nits ability to supply fast energy during workouts. \\nThis allows you to recover faster between bouts \\nof exercise, such as fast running or weightlifting. \\nBut today we know that creatine works through a \\nnumber of mechanisms, one of which is through \\nmuscle cell volumization. This is a fancy term \\nthat means the muscle cells fill up with water. \\nSince creatine is essentially a protein, it draws \\nwater from the blood and the space outside of the \\nmuscle cells (known as the interstitial fluid) into \\nthe muscle through the process of osmosis. This \\nis the major reason for the rapid weight gain that \\nis associated with creatine supplementation in the \\nearly stages of supplementation. However, this \\nincrease in cell volume causes the cell membranes \\nto stretch, which is thought to initiate long-term \\nincreases in muscle growth and strength through \\ngreater protein synthesis—the method that muscle \\ncells use to grow.\\nAnother way that creatine has been found to \\nwork is by increasing the number of satellite \\ncells in muscle fibers. Satellite cells are basically \\nmuscle stem cells, and one way that muscles grow \\nbigger and stronger is by the addition of muscle \\nsatellite cells to existing muscle fibers. A 2006 \\nstudy by Olsen and colleagues found that after \\n8 weeks of supplementing with creatine while \\nfollowing a weight training program, participants \\nhad almost 100 percent more satellite cells in \\ntheir muscle fibers than those taking a placebo. \\nAs expected, the greater number of satellite cells \\nwas associated with greater muscle size. This can \\nalso lead to greater muscle strength and power.\\nCreatine also appears to work through increases \\nin insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). IGF-I is critical \\nin initiating processes in muscle cells that lead \\nto enhanced muscle growth and muscle strength. \\nBurke (2008) reported that weight-trained partici-\\npants taking creatine while following a weightlifting \\nprogram for 8 weeks had significantly higher IGF-I \\ncontent in their muscle fibers than those taking \\na placebo.\\nAnother way that creatine appears to work is by \\ninhibiting myostatin.

Myostatin \\nis a protein that limits muscle growth. The Iranian \\nresearchers concluded that since myostatin levels \\nwere lower in the participants taking creatine, one \\nway that creatine may work to increase muscle size \\nand strength is by reducing myostatin levels, which \\nreduces the limitation that this protein places on \\nmuscle growth.\\nAlthough there is ample research showing that \\ncreatine is safe for almost anyone at any age to \\nuse, there are still myths regarding safety and side \\neffects. One of the longest-standing myths is that \\ncreatine can cause muscle cramps. Numerous stud-\\nies debunk this claim. Greenwood and colleagues \\n(2003b) concluded that NCAA football players taking \\ncreatine over the course of 3 years had no increase \\nin incidence of muscle cramps or muscle injures. In \\nfact, another 2003 study found that NCAA football \\nplayers taking creatine for one full season actually \\nhad a significant reduction in muscle cramps and \\nmuscle injuries (Greenwood et al. 2003a).\\nAnother misconception about creatine is that \\nit can lead to impaired liver and kidney function. \\nStudies done in the 1990s were some of the first \\nto show that short-term creatine supplementation \\ndoes not impair kidney function in healthy adults \\n(Poortmans et al. 1997; Poortmans and Francaux \\n1999). Another study (Cancela et al. 2008) has \\nfurther shown that 8 weeks of creatine supple -\\nmentation in football (soccer) athletes had no \\neffect on health markers that included kidney and \\nliver function. Longer-term studies have also been \\ndone to confirm creatine’s safety. Mayhew and \\ncolleagues (2002) concluded that NCAA football \\nplayers taking creatine for up to about 6 years \\nhad no long-term detrimental effects on overall \\nhealth or kidney or liver functions. In another \\nstudy (Kreider et al. 2003) NCAA football players \\ntaking creatine for close to 2 years exhibited no \\nnegative effects on general health or kidney and \\nliver function. The most recent study (Lugaresi et \\nal. 2013) involved weight-trained participants who \\nwere following a high-protein diet (0.6-1.5 grams of \\nprotein per pound of body weight) and consumed 5 \\ngrams of creatine for 1 year. Kidney function was \\nnot compromised.\\nInstead of being detrimental to your health, cre-\\natine actually provides numerous health benefits. \\nBecause phosphocreatine is important for energy \\nproduction involved in nerve cell function, creatine \\nhas been shown to provide numerous benefits \\nto the brain and the rest of the nervous system. \\nFor example, research has found that creatine \\nsupplementation enhances cognitive function and \\nmemory and may help in the treatment of Parkin-\\nson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and even \\ndepression. It may also protect against brain injury.\\nCreatine has also been found to aid cardio -\\nvascular health, such as improvement of symptoms \\nin those with congestive heart failure, and may \\neven lower cholesterol levels. One study (Earnest \\net al. 1996) discovered that male and female par-\\nticipants taking creatine for 8 weeks had a drop \\nof more than 5 percent in total cholesterol and a \\ndrop in LDL cholesterol (the bad type of cholesterol) \\nof more than 20 percent. Similarly, researchers \\nreported that 28 days of creatine supplementation \\ndecreased total cholesterol by 10 percent in healthy \\nyoung males (Arciero et al. 2001). And healthy \\nyoung males taking creatine plus a multivitamin \\nsupplement significantly reduced their levels of \\nhomocysteine (an amino acid associated with \\nheart disease), compared to those taking just the \\nmultivitamin supplement (Korzun 2004).\\nSo be sure to get a dose of creatine before work-\\nouts to ensure that your levels of it in the muscle \\ncells are maximized. And get another dose after \\nworkouts, when it will be preferentially taken up by \\nthe muscle cells, and replenish any that was lost \\nduring the workout. How much you take pre- and \\npostworkout depends on the form of creatine you \\nuse. If you go with creatine monohydrate, take 3 \\nto 5 grams before and after workouts. Although \\ncreatine monohydrate is the most studied form of \\ncreatine, creatine hydrochloride is a form of cre -\\natine that I have worked with extensively. It tends to \\nbe absorbed better than creatine monohydrate and \\ncauses less stomach distress. If using this form, \\ntake 1.5 to 2 grams before and after workouts.\\nbeta-alanine—A nonessential amino acid that is \\nproduced naturally in the liver.

This \\nincreases the muscle’s ability to maintain stronger \\ncontractions for longer periods during exercise. In \\nother words, you can lift more weight and complete \\nmore reps during the later stages of your workouts. \\nAnd this ability leads to greater gains in strength \\nand power, as well as muscle mass, while also \\npromoting greater fat loss.\\nParticipants taking just over 4 grams of beta-ala-\\nnine per day for 30 days were able to increase the \\nnumber of reps they could complete during a squat \\nworkout by almost 25 percent more than those \\ntaking a placebo (Hoffman et al. 2008). Another \\nstudy found that 4 weeks of beta-alanine supple -\\nmentation in amateur boxers increased their average \\npunching power in the last 10 seconds of simulated \\n3-minute rounds by 2000 percent more than those \\ntaking a placebo (Donovan et al. 2012). The ability \\nto maintain punching power late in the round is \\nsimilar to the ability to maintain more strength and \\npower later in workouts, meaning you can lift more \\nweight for more reps. The most recent study, found \\nthat soldiers taking beta-alanine for four weeks \\nincreased jumping power and even marksmanship. \\nThis suggests not only a muscle performance benefit \\nof beta-alanine, but also possible improved psycho-\\nmotor performance (Hoffman et al. 2014).\\nResearch also shows a great synergy of beta-al-\\nanine with creatine. One study reported that \\nweight-trained athletes consuming 3.2 grams of \\nbeta-alanine plus 10 grams of creatine daily for \\n12 weeks gained significantly more muscle mass \\nwhile simultaneously losing significant body fat, \\nas compared to those taking just 10 grams of cre-\\natine alone and those taking a placebo (Hoffman \\net al. 2006). Both the creatine-only group and the \\nplacebo group did not lose any body fat. \\nThe absolute lowest amount of beta-alanine \\nconsumed to provide the benefits listed previously \\nis 1.6 grams per day. However, research on various \\nlevels of supplementation shows that around 2 \\ngrams per day or 4 grams per day each may provide \\neven better benefits. Since the uptake of nutrients \\nsuch as amino acids beta-alanine is improved \\naround workouts, I recommend getting a dose of \\nbeta-alanine preworkout and postworkout. Blood \\nlevels of beta-alanine peak within 30 minutes of \\nsupplementing with it, and it completely leaves the \\ncirculation within 3 hours of consuming. So it makes \\nsense to get about a 2-gram dose of beta-alanine \\nboth before workouts and then immediately after.\\nGOAL 9: COVER YOUR VITAMIN \\n AND MINERAL NEEDS \\nWITH A SUPPLEMENT\\nAthletes and those who train intensely lose many \\ncritical vitamins and minerals, such as B vitamins, \\nvitamin C, chromium, selenium, zinc, magnesium, \\nand copper. This is due to a variety of factors, such \\nas loss of the minerals in sweat and urine, as well \\nas increased use for energy production during \\nthe workout and recovery and protein synthesis \\nafter training.\\nEven if you were careful to eat a well-rounded \\ndiet, you may not be getting adequate amounts \\nof critical micronutrients. That’s because our \\nfood supply today is lower in many of these vita -\\nmins and minerals due to conventional farming \\npractices, such as overfarming, which dwindles \\nthe nutrient density of the soil. And the grain \\nfeeding of conventional cattle and chickens also \\ndwindles the micronutrient content of milk, beef, \\neggs, and chicken. Plus certain foods inhibit the \\nabsorption of some micronutrients. Refined sugar, \\nas well as white-flour products (like white bread), \\ncan lower blood levels of minerals, such as zinc \\nand magnesium. Foods rich in calcium (such as \\ndairy products) inhibit absorption of both zinc and \\nmagnesium by the small intestine. Foods rich in \\nphytates (phosphorous compounds found in whole-\\ngrain breads, cereals, and legumes) also hinder the \\nabsorption of zinc by the small intestine.\\nNumerous studies also show that vitamin and \\nmineral supplements reduce the risk of certain dis-\\neases and death. The most recent was from Li and \\ncolleagues (2012). The researchers reported that \\nin about 24,000 people, those taking vitamin and \\nmineral supplements at the start of the study had a \\n42 percent reduced risk of all-cause mortality over \\nthe 11 years of the study and a 48 percent reduced \\nrisk of cancer-related death.

A study reported that supplementing with \\nmultivitamins, especially those including vitamins \\nA, C, and E, reduced the risk of colon cancer (Park \\net al. 2010). Another study reported that women \\nusing multivitamins had a 30 percent reduced risk \\nof heart attack (Rautiainen et al. 2010).

Don’t worry \\ntoo much about the amount of zinc or magnesium \\nsince you should take them separately from a \\nmultivitamin anyway.\\nConsider getting more than the DV , or likely \\nwhat’s in your multivitamin, of the following vita -\\nmins and minerals:\\n• B vitamins: These water-soluble vitamins \\nare typically low in those who train. They are \\noften lost in sweat. Take a B-complex 100 \\nthat provides 100 milligrams of B1, B2, B3, \\npantothenic acid (B5), and B6 and at least \\n100 micrograms of B 12, 400 micrograms \\nof folic acid, and 300 micrograms of biotin \\nonce or twice a day.\\n• Vitamin C: This is also a water-soluble \\nvitamin that can be lost in sweat. Take 250 \\nto 500 milligrams of vitamin C once a day.\\n• Vitamin D: This vitamin is critical for your \\nhealth, physique, and performance. It aids \\nfat loss, testosterone levels, bone health, \\nand mood. Take 2000 to 6000 IU of vitamin \\nD3 per day.\\n• Vitamin E: New research shows that vitamin \\nE is critical for muscle recovery. Unless your \\nmultivitamin has at least 400 IU of E, you \\nwill want to take a vitamin E supplement \\nproviding 400 to 800 IU per day. Be sure \\nto buy the natural forms, called d-alpha-to-\\ncopherols, which are absorbed and used \\nbetter than the synthetic forms, called \\ndl-alpha tocopherols.\\n• Calcium: Important for bone health, fat \\nloss, and even testosterone levels, calcium \\nin the amount of 1000 to 2000 milligrams \\nper day is required. Take 500 to 600 mil -\\nligrams of calcium (any more may not get \\nabsorbed properly) one or two times per \\nday (depending on how much calcium you \\nget from your diet) separately from other \\nminerals and vitamins.\\n• Zinc and magnesium: Get 30 milligrams \\nof zinc and 450 milligrams of magnesium \\n30 to 60 minutes before bedtime. It will \\nhelp increase sleep quality and keep your \\ntestosterone levels and muscle strength \\nup.

Maybe you’re a vegan, and dairy-based pro-\\ntein powders are not on your diet. Whatever it is, \\nuse these goals as a guideline, but stick only with \\nthe ones that work for you. Take these goals and \\nadapt them to your schedule and your body, or find \\nones that work better for you, or create your own. \\nYou have a unique biochemistry, and not everyone \\nreacts the same way to food or training. Be your own \\nguinea pig. If something works for you, it doesn’t \\nmatter whether or not it works for anyone else.\\nSAMPLE MEAL PLANS\\nThe following meal plans are based on the guide-\\nlines discussed previously. I have provided one \\nsample day for those who train at any of the four \\ntimes of day:\\n1. First thing in the morning (see table 27.1)\\n2. At lunch time (see table 27.2)\\n3. Before dinner (see table 27.3)\\n4. After dinner later at night (see table 27.4)\\nThese are the four most common workout win -\\ndows of the day. The following meals are sam -\\nples to be followed on workout days and provide \\nroughly 3,300 calories, 290 grams of protein, \\n330 grams of carbohydrate, and 90 grams of fat. \\nFor a 180-pound person, that equates to about \\n18 calories, a little over 1.5 grams of protein, \\nalmost 2 grams of carbohydrate, and 0.5 gram \\nof fat per pound. On rest days, skip the post -\\nworkout meal and supplements and have the \\npreworkout meal as a snack that day. Take the \\nsuggested preworkout supplements with break -\\nfast on rest days. That means a reduction to \\nabout 3,000 calories, 260 grams of protein, 290 \\ngrams of carbohydrate, and 85 grams of fat. For a \\n180-pounder, that equates to about 17 calories, \\na bit under 1.5 grams of protein, a bit over 1.6 \\ngrams of carbohydrate, and just under 0.5 gram \\nof fat per pound. These sample diets will work \\nwell as a starting point for those weighing 160 \\nto 200 pounds. If you weigh significantly less or \\nmore than this range, modify the macronutrients \\nand calories for your body weight.'),\n",

The guidelines discussed in chapter 27 are \\nthe same guidelines you want to follow to maximize \\nfat loss. After all, when you talk about dropping \\nbody fat, you still want to at least maintain, if not \\nbuild, lean muscle mass and muscle strength. And \\nusing the programs in chapter 13 along with the \\ninformation in chapter 27 and 28, you can.\\nWhile chapter 27 broke down the nutrition \\nguidelines into goals, chapter 28 breaks down \\nthe nutrition information to maximize fat loss \\ninto steps. That’s because fat loss is a continual \\nprocess, and your diet must change gradually \\nover time. The worst thing that you can do is to \\nimmediately jump down to a very low-calorie and \\nlow-carbohydrate diet. For example, many people \\nask me if going on a keto diet where almost all \\ncarbohydrate is removed from the diet is a smart \\nplan. The answer is no. Yes, it can result in very \\nrapid fat loss at the beginning of the diet. But \\nafter a couple of months or less, when the fat loss \\nstops and they hit a plateau, they have little wiggle \\nroom to remove more calories from their diet and \\ncontinue losing body fat.\\nWhen you diet, your body responds by going into \\nstarvation mode. That basically means that your \\nbody slows down your metabolic rate, which is the \\nnumber of calories you burn just sitting around. \\nThe reason for this is to conserve energy stores, \\nnamely your body fat. Your body prefers to not be \\nlean, since body fat is stored energy that it can rely \\non in times of food scarcity. In developed countries, \\nfood scarcity is obviously not a real threat for most \\npeople. But your body has developed this process \\nshould there be a time when food is scarce. So \\nonce you reduce your caloric intake, your body \\nreacts by slowing down your metabolic rate. The \\ngreater you reduce your caloric intake, the bigger \\nthe drop in your metabolic rate and the quicker \\nthis will happen.\\nTo prevent a massive slowing of your metabolic \\nrate, you need to gradually reduce your caloric \\nintake little by little. Of course, exercise will help \\nto keep your metabolic rate higher, but it cannot \\nprevent the gradual reduction of it as you reduce \\ncalories. So you actually want to start a diet for fat \\nloss by eating as many calories as you can while \\nstill losing weight. This way you will have ample \\nroom to keep reducing calories as your metabolic \\nrate drops and fat loss hits a plateau. This way \\nyou can keep losing body fat. Figure out how many \\ncalories to start your diet with by reading through \\nstep 1: analyze your diet.\\nSTEPPING UP FAT LOSS\\nFollowing are the eight steps you want to follow \\nto maximize fat loss while building muscle and \\nstrength or, at the very least, maintaining muscle \\nmass.\\nStep 1: Analyze Your Diet\\nTo get the best estimate of where you should start \\nfor calories, you will need to take an honest look at \\nyour current diet. I typically recommend recording \\neverything you eat for one full week. But if that \\nseems daunting, do at least two weekdays and \\none weekend day. If you have a scale, weigh food \\nsuch as chicken, beef, and fish. For liquids and \\ngrains like rice and cereal, use measuring cups and \\nmeasuring spoons. Or if you have a good take on'),\n",

For packaged foods, use the nutrition \\nfacts label on the box; for other foods, use a reli-\\nable source, such as USDA site. The direct link to \\ntheir food database is http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/\\nndb/search/list.\\nIt’s important that you do not alter your typical \\ndiet when you record your food intake. One trick \\nthat we use to keep people from steering astray \\nfrom a diet is to have them record everything they \\neat. When they have a weak moment and crave \\ndoughnuts, knowing that they have to record that in \\na food log helps them avoid eating the doughnuts. \\nBut during this week, do not avoid eating any of the \\nfoods that you normally do. The point is to assess \\nyour true current diet so that you know where to \\nstart your new diet. If you alter it, it can actually \\nwork against your fat-loss efforts.\\nCalculate the amount of calories, grams of pro-\\ntein, grams of carbohydrate, and grams of total fat \\nfor each food that you eat. Then add these up for \\nall the foods that you eat each day. Once you have \\nthe total amount of calories and grams of protein, \\ncarbohydrate, and fat for each day, you need to get \\nan average of all the days. So if you recorded 7 \\ndays of food intake, then add the calories up for \\nall 7 days and divide this number by 7 to get the \\naverage caloric intake for the 7 days. If you did just \\n3 days, then obviously you would add up the total \\ncalories for the 3 days and divide by 3. Do this \\nalso for grams of protein, grams of carbohydrate, \\nand grams of fat. But the critical factor is your \\naverage caloric intake. Take your average caloric \\nintake and divide it by your body weight in pounds \\nto calculate your average calories relative to your \\nbody weight. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds \\nand you consumed an average of 4,000 calories \\nper day, you currently consume an average of 20 \\ncalories per pound of body weight.\\nStep 2: Build Your Initial Diet\\nUsing the muscle building guidelines in chapter \\n27, the most critical goals that you want to focus \\non to build your initial diet are goal 1 (focus on \\nprotein) and goal 2 (get ample fat). Start your diet \\nby making sure that you consume 1.5 grams of \\nprotein per pound of body weight and 0.5 gram \\nof fat per pound. Since there are 4 calories per \\ngram of protein, that means that you will con -\\nsume 6 calories from protein per pound of body \\nweight. Since fat has about 9 calories per gram, \\nyou will be consuming 4.5 calories from fat per \\npound of body weight. Adding the calories from \\nprotein and the calories from fat equates to 10.5 \\ncalories per pound of body weight. Subtract 10.5 \\ncalories from 20 calories (the number of calo -\\nries per pound of body weight you currently eat), \\nwhich equals 9.5 calories. This is the number of \\ncalories you can consume from carbohydrate per \\npound of body weight. Since there are 4 calories \\nper gram of carbohydrate, that equals about 2.5 \\ngrams. Round down to 2 grams of carbohydrate \\nper pound of body weight. So your new diet will \\nconsist of about 1.5 grams of protein, 2 grams of \\ncarbohydrate, 0.5 gram of fat, and 18.5 calories \\nper pound of body weight. For the 200-pounder, \\nthat equates to 3,700 calories, 300 grams of pro-\\ntein, 400 grams of carbohydrate, and 100 grams \\nof fat per day. See sample diet for a 200-pound \\nperson following these guidelines in tables 28.1, \\n28.2, 28.3, or 28.4 based on when you work out. \\nNote that the sample meal plans in this chapter \\nare very similar for reasons of illustrating how \\nto change the diet when you move through the \\nsteps. This does not mean that you should eat \\nthe same foods every day and the same foods in \\neach step of the diet. Quite the contrary. You want \\nto have as much variety in your diet as possible. \\nFor food alternatives to replace the foods in the \\nsample diets, refer to the food alternatives list \\nin appendix B.\\nFollow this diet for as long as you continue \\nlosing fat. Note that you will likely gain muscle \\nmass even though you are dropping body fat. So \\ndo not use the scale as your major indicator of \\nfat loss. Use the mirror and waist size or the fit of \\nthe waist on your pants. An even better option is \\nto have your body fat professionally measured by \\na seven-site skinfold caliper, underwater weighing, \\nor DEXA scan. Do not use bioelectrical impedance, \\nwhich calculates percent body fat on how fast it \\ntakes a current to travel through your body.

Since you want \\nto keep protein and fat where they are to maximize \\nmuscle growth and strength gains, your best bet \\nis to whittle away at your carb intake. Each time \\nyou hit a plateau in your diet and it seems like you \\nhave not made any progress in losing fat for at least \\na week, it’s time to reduce carbohydrate. You will \\nreduce carbohydrate by 0.25 gram per pound of \\nbody weight each time you need to cut again. That \\nwill reduce your total caloric intake by about 1 cal-\\norie per pound of body weight. So for a 200-pound \\nperson, that equates to about a 200-calorie cut.\\nBecause our sample 200-pounder is currently \\nconsuming 2 grams of carbohydrate per pound of \\nbody weight, his first cut will be bring him down to \\n1.75 grams per pound of body weight. Where you \\nstart reducing your carbohydrate depends on when \\nyou train. But regardless of when you train, you will \\ncut postworkout carbohydrate absolutely last. For \\nthose who train first thing in the morning, start \\nreducing carbohydrate from the end of the day and \\nworking up as you continue to drop. For those who \\ntrain at night, start reducing your carbohydrate from \\nthe start of the day and work down as you continue \\nto cut. It gets a little trickier, if you train at lunch \\nor before dinner. This will bounce around from end \\nto end a bit. See the sample diets for guidelines \\non dropping carbohydrate from your diet with each \\n0.25-gram-per-pound cut.\\nYou will progressively cut carbohydrate each time \\nfat loss hits a plateau until you are down to around \\njust 0.25 gram of carbohydrate per pound. That is, if \\nyou ever have to get that low. Many will not have to get \\nanywhere close to that. But it all depends on where \\nyou are starting from, how active your training is, \\nand how your body responds to the training and diet.\\nThe following sample meals in tables 28.5 \\nthrough 28.8 are for those making their first cut \\nin carbohydrate from 2.0 to 1.75 grams per pound \\nof body weight (or 350 grams of carbohydrate total \\nfor the 200-pounder). This drops calories to 17 per \\npound of body weight or about 3,400 for the 200-\\npound sample person. Remember that these meal \\nplans are based on workout days. On rest days, \\nskip the postworkout meal and have the preworkout \\nmeal as a snack.\\nTABLE 28.5 Sample Meal Plan When \\nExercising First Thing in the Morning\\nPreworkout 1 (as soon as you wake/30-45 minutes before \\nworkout)\\n5-10 grams BCAAs \\n2-5 grams creatine (depending on form)\\n2-3 grams beta-alanine\\n20-30 grams protein from a mixed protein powder (whey/\\ncasein)\\n1 large apple\\nPostworkout (within 30 minutes after workout)\\n20-40 grams protein from a mixed protein powder (whey/\\ncasein)\\n30-40 grams fast-digesting carbohydrate (dextrose, Pixy \\nStix, gummy bears, white bread)\\n5-10 grams BCAAs \\n2-5 grams creatine (depending on form)\\n2-3 grams beta-alanine\\nBreakfast (30-60 minutes after postworkout meal)\\n20-30 grams protein of a mixed protein powder (whey/casein)\\n3 whole eggs, 3 egg whites, and 1 tbsp olive oil \\n(scrambled eggs cooked in olive oil)\\n2 cups cooked oatmeal (1 cup dry oats before cooking) \\nand 1 tbsp honey (mix honey in oatmeal)\\nLate-morning snack\\n1 cup low-fat cottage cheese, 1 cup sliced pineapple, \\nand 5 Triscuit whole-wheat crackers (mix pineapple in \\ncottage cheese and eat with crackers)\\nLunch\\n6 oz. can albacore tuna\\n2 slices whole-wheat (or Ezekiel) bread\\n1 tbsp light mayonnaise\\n1 large piece of fruit (e.g., apple, orange, banana)\\nAfternoon snack\\n20-30 grams protein of a mixed protein powder (whey/casein)\\n1 tbsp peanut butter, 1 tbsp jam, and 2 slices whole-\\nwheat (or Ezekiel) bread (make peanut butter sandwich \\nto eat with shake)\\nDinner\\n8 oz. steak (or salmon or other fish, or chicken or other \\npoultry, or pork)\\n1 cup of cooked black beans (or pinto beans)\\n2 cups mixed green salad\\n2 tbsp salad dressing (olive oil and vinegar)\\nBedtime snack\\n20-30 grams protein from a mixed protein powder (whey/\\ncasein) or 1 cup cottage cheese or 1 cup Greek yogurt \\n(with 1 teaspoon honey)\\n1 tbsp peanut butter (can add to shake or Greek yogurt or \\neat separately)'),\n",

Once carbohydrate drops to 0.5 gram per \\npound of body weight, it is advisable to include a \\nhigher-carbohydrate day every week or so. This can \\nhelp to keep your metabolic rate higher despite the \\nfact that carbohydrate and caloric intake is so low. \\nPlus, it works well as an incentive to get through the \\nweek. Knowing that you have a higher-carb day to look \\nforward to helps you make it through the low-carb \\nperiod. Most people find that they better police them-\\nselves during the low-carbohydrate days so that they \\ncan feel like they earned the high-carb day. Once you \\nhave enjoyed the higher-carb day and enjoyed some \\nof the food you were craving, like bread and pasta, \\nit’s easier to go back to the lower-carbohydrate diet.\\nIt doesn’t matter what day of the week your \\nhigh-carbohydrate day is, but you don’t want to \\ngo any less frequent than about every 7 days. A \\nweekend day works best for most people, but any \\nday of the week will work. Protein and fat should \\nstay about the same; however, you can drop them \\nsomewhat on your higher-carbohydrate day. But \\ndon’t allow protein to drop much lower than 1 gram \\nper pound of body weight, and don’t allow fat to go \\nany lower than 0.25 gram per pound. You should \\nshoot for about 2 grams of carbohydrate per pound \\nof body weight on your high-carb day. That’s about \\n400 grams for the 200-pounder.\\nYour best options for high-carbohydrate foods are \\nlow-glycemic or slow-digesting carbohydrate, such \\nas oatmeal, whole-wheat breads and pastas, and \\nsweet potatoes. However, if you train on your high-\\ncarb day, then you should still consume high-glyce-\\nmic carbohydrate immediately after the workout. \\nWhile the majority of your carboh ydrate should \\ncome from low-GI carbohydrate, you can enjoy some \\nhigh-GI carbohydrate throughout the day.

After \\nall, you still need vegetables. And although they \\nprovide a good deal of fiber, they also provide real \\nnet carbohydrate. Some experts recommend not \\ncounting carbohydrate from vegetables as part of \\nyour daily total of carbohydrate due to the high fiber \\ncontent of most vegetables. Yet the carbohydrate \\ncontent of most vegetables is less than 50 percent \\nfiber. So if you’re eating a lot of vegetables, this \\ncan add up. Instead, I prefer to count even fiber \\nas part of daily carb intake, but realizing that at \\nthe lowest point, carb intake will still be a good \\n30 to 60 grams depending on the diet, or roughly \\nabout 0.25 gram per pound of body weight. Small \\namounts of carbohydrate are also in most protein \\nshakes. And since you need to rely on it to maxi-\\nmize your results in the gym, you’ll need to leave \\nroom for it in your diet. The bottom line is that at \\nthe lowest point, you can never truly get to zero \\ngrams of carbohydrate.\\nRemember that during this phase of the diet, you \\nshould definitely include one high-carbohydrate day \\neach week as discussed in step 4. Having this high-\\ncarb day to look forward to will make a difference \\nin your ability to tolerate such extremes in dieting.\\nYou can find sample meals for making the \\nfinal cut in carbohydrate from 0.5 to 0.25 \\ngram per pound of body weight (or 50 grams \\nof carbohydrate total for the 200-pounder) \\nat \\nwww.humankinetics.com/products/\\nall-products/Jim-Stoppanis-Encyclopedia-of-  \\nMuscle--Strength-2nd-edition. This drops calories \\nto about 10 per pound of body w eight or about \\n2,000 for the 200-pound sample person. Protein \\nand fat stay steady as they have throughout. \\nRemember that these meal plans are based on \\nworkout days. On rest days, skip the postworkout \\nmeal and have the preworkout meal as a snack.\\nStep 6: Switch to Intermittent \\nFasting (IF)\\nOnce you get down to 0.25 gram of carbohydrate \\nper pound of body weight, it’s next to impossi -\\nble to go any lower in carbohydrate. This small \\namount of carboh ydrate is coming from protein \\nsources and vegetables. If you get this low in \\ncarbohydrate and hit a plateau, then there is a \\nvery good chance that it is because you are at \\nextremely low levels of body fat but want to get \\neven lower. For men, this would be somewhere \\naround 5 percent; for women it is somewhere \\naround 12 percent. To keep losing body fat, you \\ncould continue by dropping protein and fat, but \\nthat could compromise muscle mass. So an alter-\\nnative to try first is intermittent fasting.\\nIntermittent fasting is a technique where you \\nfast for a good portion of the day and then you \\nhave a window of time where you can eat. The type \\nof intermittent fasting that I have found to work \\nbest for losing body fat and maintaining muscle is \\n16/8 intermittent fasting. That means that you fast \\nfor 16 hours and your feeding window is 8 hours. \\nFor the average person, the time of day you fast \\nand the time of day you eat make no difference. \\nHowever, those who work out should manipulate \\ntheir fasting and feeding windows based on when \\nthey train.\\nIf you train in the morning, then I suggest that \\nyou start your 8-hour feeding window with your \\npostworkout meal. That means that you would \\ntrain completely fasted and your first meal would \\nbe your postworkout shake. But since you skipped \\nyour preworkout shake, your postworkout shake \\nshould include both your pre- and postworkout \\nshakes and supplements. For example, if you train \\nfrom 7:00 to 8:30 a.m., then your feeding window \\nstarts at 8:30 a.m. with your postworkout shake \\nand ends at 4:30 p.m. with your bedtime snack of \\nslow-digesting protein. If you train in the morning, \\nyet ending your feeding window in the late afternoon \\nis too early for you, then you could postpone your \\npostworkout shake by 2 to 3 hours. It’s not ideal for \\nmaintaining muscle mass, but it certainly will not \\nTABLE 28.12 Sample Meal Plan When Exercising After \\nDinner (continued)'),\n",

The following sample meal plans \\nin tables 28.13 through 28.16 show you how to \\napply intermittent fasting for the four main training \\ntimes throughout the day. And while I suggest that \\nyou schedule your fasting and eating around the \\ntime you train, you can also adjust the time you \\ntrain to better match when you want to fast and \\neat. If you normally train in the morning but find \\nthat it’s almost impossible for you to fast at night \\nbecause your cravings are stronger at night, then \\ntrain later in the day so that you fast in the morning \\nand eat at night.\\nIntermittent fasting has become increasingly \\npopular in the last few years. However, I have been \\ninterested in its application for fat loss for a couple \\nof decades. The lab where I did my postdoctoral \\nat Yale University School of Medicine did a bit of \\nwork on fasting and fat loss before 2000. Our \\ngroup published several papers showing that one \\nof the key mechanisms in fasting-induced fat loss \\nhas to do with an increase in the activity of genes \\nthat increase the number of calories the body \\nburns (Pilegaard et al. 2003; Hildebrandt et al. \\n2000). More specifically, when you fast, it turns on \\ngenes that encode for certain uncoupling proteins. \\nIn simple terms, these uncoupling proteins poke \\nholes in the mitochondria inside muscle cells. \\nThe mitochondria are where most of your energy \\nis derived from, especially at rest. By poking holes \\nin the mitochondria, they produce less energy. So \\nthey have to burn far more calories to produce the \\nsame amount of energy in the form of ATP .\\nFasting also works through a number of mecha-\\nnisms that lead to increased calorie and fat burn \\nand enhanced fat loss. Research also suggest \\nthat fasting provides numerous health benefits, \\nsuch as lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels \\n(Mattson and Wan 2005).\\nSome proponents claim that IF even benefits \\nmuscle building. But this is where I disagree with \\ntheir logic. There really is no research suggesting \\nthat IF benefits muscle growth over a traditional \\ndiet. In fact, from my personal experience and the \\ndata I’ve collected over the years, it would appear \\nthat IF would limit muscle growth as compared to \\nfollowing the rules covered in chapter 27 for eating \\nto maximize muscle growth.\\nThere is no debating the fact that intermittent \\nfasting works well to enhance fat loss. However, it \\nis not a method of dieting that needs to be used \\nfrom the get-go. Instead, I recommend using it once \\nyou’ve hit a plateau and you can no longer lower \\ncarbohydrate. Since you want to keep protein and \\nfat as high as possible, IF allows you one more step \\nbefore you need to start whittling away at those \\ntwo critical macros to lower calories and continue \\nlosing body fat.\\nThe following sample diets in tables 28.13 \\nthrough 28.16 show how to apply IF based on when \\nyou train. You will still consume the same number \\nof calories, grams of protein, carbohydrate, and fat \\nas you did in the prior phase of the diet. You should \\neven consume the same number of meals. Since \\nyou are cramming so many meals into an 8-hour \\ntime frame, meals will come more frequently than \\nyou were eating, maybe an hour or two apart and \\nas soon as 30 minutes in some cases. If you find \\nthat you cannot consume this many meals, you \\ncan also combine some of them. For example, the \\nsnack before dinner is a protein shake and peanut \\nbutter. You can have this shake with dinner and \\nenjoy the peanut butter as a dessert.\\nWhile you should do your best to consume the \\nsame amount of food as your previous diet phase, \\nit is not the end of the world if you simply cannot. \\nThis is one of the fringe benefits of IF. You often \\ncannot consume that much food in the 8-hour time \\nwindow, which lowers calories and aids fat loss. \\nYet this is also one reason why you should wait \\nuntil a later stage in your diet to employ IF. If you \\nstart it too soon, you may not be able to consume \\nenough food during your feeding window, which will \\nmake it hard to drop calories in later stages as \\nyour fat loss plateaus.\\nAlthough the meals in the sample diets still list \\nbreakfast, lunch, and dinner, these meals may not \\nnecessarily be consumed at the normal time for \\nthat meal. In the sample morning workout, if you \\nfinish your workout at 8:00 a.m. and consume \\nyour postworkout meal at this time, your feeding \\nwindow ends at 4:00 p.m. That means that lunch \\nwill be some time before noon and dinner would \\nprobably be before 3:00 p.m.\\nYou should also continue to include one high-car-\\nbohydrate day each week with IF. You can either \\ndo the high-carb day as an IF day with an 8-hour \\nfeeding window or try eating at any hour of the day \\nto see what works best for you. Some like having \\nthe ability to let the IF go for a day when getting \\ntheir high-carb day. It helps them stay true to their \\ndiet during the rest of the week. If that works for \\nyou, then use it.'),\n",

However, every body \\nreacts differently. So if you have hit a fat-loss pla-\\nteau with low-carbohydrate IF, then you will need to \\nadjust your diet yet again. As mentioned, once you \\nare down to 0.25 gram of carbohydrate per pound \\nof body weight, it’s fairly impossible to go any lower \\nin carbohydrate without removing vegetables and \\nprotein shakes, which you really do not want to do. \\nThe only thing left to do now is lower the other mac-\\nronutrients—fat and protein. This will bring calories \\ndown again and allow you to burn more body fat.\\nSo you will cut out some protein shakes, such as \\nwith breakfast, and cut out some fat from peanut \\nbutter and by reducing the amount of salad dressing \\nyou use. This will bring protein intake down to about \\n1.25 grams per pound of body weight and fat to \\nabout 0.25 gram per pound of body weight.

But, as I \\nhave said earlier, every body is different, and there \\nis always one person who is an outlier and does not \\nrespond as you would expect. So if you have hit a \\nplateau in fat loss and have some more body fat to \\nstrip away, then you would simply continue making \\nsmall reductions in your calories by dropping more \\nfat and protein. You could cut out olive oil completely \\nand use noncaloric cooking spray and just vinegar for \\nsalad dressing. And you could reduce your protein \\nmeals by about a quarter of the serving size. These \\nsmall changes will allow you to keep calories slowly \\ndropping while you continue losing fat.\\nMAINTAINING YOUR NEW \\nLEAN BODY\\nA common question I get from those dieting down \\nto low levels of body fat is how to maintain that \\nlean body without gaining body fat while trying to \\nbuild more muscle. It is quite possible to do so if \\nyou are very careful and detailed with your diet. You \\nsimply can’t go back to the way you were eating \\nbefore you started to get serious with your fat-loss \\ndiet. That will lead to rapid fat gain because your \\nmetabolism is a bit slower at this moment. Just \\nlike reducing carbohydrate and calories was a slow \\nand progressive process, so should be your return \\nto a higher-carb and higher-calorie diet. Simply \\nput, you will reverse the steps that brought you to \\nwhere you now are.\\nYour strategy for gaining muscle but not fat will \\nbe to slowly move to the step before your current \\nstep in the diet process. So if you left off at step \\n7, then you will move into step 6 of the diet. How \\nlong you stay there depends on how your body \\nreacts. I would suggest staying with a diet step \\nno less than two weeks before moving to the \\nnext step. Your body will need time to adjust to \\nthe higher carbohydrate and caloric intake. It will \\nrespond by increasing your metabolic rate, which \\nwill allow you to consume more carbohydrate and \\nmore calories without adding body fat or at least \\nnot adding much body fat. You will likely not be able \\nto maintain the exact amount of body fat that you \\nreached in your final stages of the diet while you \\nare adding carbohydrate and calories. But if you \\ndo it slowly enough, a very minimal amount of fat \\nwill be added.\\nIf you find that you are gaining fat readily when \\nyou move up a step, do some diet cycling. For \\nexample, if you are currently at 0.5 gram of car -\\nbohydrate per pound of body weight and find that \\nmoving up to 0.75 gram of carbohydrate per pound \\nis putting some fat on your physique, then stick \\nwith the 0.5 gram for two days and then doing a \\nday of 0.75 gram and then back to 0.5 gram for \\ntwo days and back to 0.75 gram. Then eventually \\nmove to alternating 0.5 gram and 0.75 gram every \\nday. Then eventually move into consuming 0.75 \\ngram of carbohydrate every day.\\nThe nice thing about maintaining your lean \\nphysique by slowly increasing carbohydrate and \\ncalories is that you can afford to include a real \\ncheat day once per week. So instead of having \\na “clean” high-carb day once a week where fat \\nis relatively low and you are focusing on low-fat \\ncarbohydrate like rice, oatmeal, and popcorn, and \\nyou can also include some “dirty” foods like ice \\ncream, doughnuts, and pizza.'),\n",

Common aerobic exercise activities are \\nwalking, jogging, running, cycling, stair climbing, working \\nout on elliptical exercise machines, rowing, swimming, \\ndancing, and aerobic dance classes.\\nagonist muscle —A muscle responsible for producing a \\nspecific movement through concentric muscle action. \\nFor example, during the biceps curl exercise, the biceps \\nmuscle is the agonist muscle.\\nanaerobic exercise —Exercise that is higher in intensity \\nthan aerobic work. Anaerobic exercise uses up oxygen \\nmore quickly than the body can replenish it in the work-\\ning muscles. Anaerobic exercise uses stored-muscle \\nATP , phosphocreatine, and glycogen to supply its energy \\nneeds. Common anaerobic activities are weightlifting \\nand sprinting.\\nantagonist muscle—The muscle responsible for actively \\nopposing the concentric muscle action of the agonist \\nmuscle. Although this seems counterintuitive, the \\nopposing force is necessary for joint stability during the \\nmovement. For example, during the biceps curl exercise, \\nthe triceps muscle is the antagonist muscle.\\nanterior—Anatomical term referring to the front of the body.\\nassistance exercise—Typically single-joint exercises such \\nas the biceps curl, triceps extension, and deltoid lateral \\nraise. These exercises involve only a single muscle group.\\nATP—See adenosine triphosphate.\\natrophy—Wasting away of any part, organ, tissue, or cell, \\nsuch as the atrophy of muscle fibers caused by inactivity.\\nballistic stretch —This type of muscle stretch involves \\ndynamic muscle action in which the muscles are \\nstretched suddenly in a bouncing movement.

Cheating \\nis not generally recommended because it can lead to \\ninjury. However, it can sometimes help a lifter push the \\nmuscles beyond muscle failure. An example of cheating \\nwould be forcibly swinging the upper body to help com-\\nplete a standing biceps curl.\\ncompound exercise—An exercise that involves more than one \\nmuscle group to perform the exercise. Therefore, movement \\noccurs at more than one joint. For this reason, compound \\nexercises are often called multijoint exercise.

If an athlete \\nstops overreaching in time, the athlete can avoid the \\ndeleterious effects of overtraining and actually rebound \\nwith rapid advances in strength and muscle mass.\\novertraining—When an athlete overreaches for too long, \\nhe or she reaches the point of overtraining. Chronically \\nexceeding the body’s ability to recover by overreaching \\ncauses the body to stop progressing and actually lose \\nsome of the gains that were made in strength and \\nmuscle mass. Besides impairing athletic performance, \\novertraining can increase the risk of injury or disease. \\nThe early signs of overtraining from too much weight \\ninclude increased resting heart rate, difficulty in sleeping, \\nincreased sweating, and altered emotions. The early \\nsigns of overtraining from lifting too much volume or \\ntoo often include decreased resting heart rate, digestion \\nproblems, fatigue, and lower blood pressure.\\npassive stretching—This type of stretching involves having \\na partner assist in moving joints through their ranges of \\nmotion. This allows for a greater range of motion than \\nwhat can be reached when stretching alone.\\npeak—The absolute zenith of competitive condition \\nachieved by an athlete.\\npecs—A slang term that refers to the pectoralis muscles.\\nperiodization—The systematic manipulation of the acute \\nvariables of training over a period that may range from \\ndays to years.\\nphosphocreatine (PCr) —An energy-rich compound that \\nplays a critical role in providing energy for muscle action \\nby maintaining ATP concentration.\\nplantar flexion —Moving the top of the foot away from \\nthe shin, such as when pointing the toes down for heel \\nraises.\\npositive phase of repetition—The concentric portion of the \\nrepetition. Examples of the positive phase include the \\npressing of the barbell off the chest during the bench \\npress and the curling up of the weight during a barbell curl.\\npowerlifting—A form of competitive weightlifting that fea-\\ntures three lifts: the squat, bench press, and deadlift. \\nPowerlifting is contested both nationally and interna -\\ntionally in a variety of weight and age classes for both \\nmen and women.\\npreexhaust —The use of single-joint exercises before \\nmultijoint exercises in an effort to exhaust a particular \\nmuscle group so that it becomes the weak link in the \\nmultijoint exercise.\\nprimary exercise —An exercise that is most specific to \\nthe goals of the lifter. These exercises must involve the \\nmuscle groups in which the person is most interested \\nin gaining strength.\\npronation—Rotating the wrist inward.\\nprone—Lying horizontally on the abdomen.\\npump—A term commonly used by bodybuilders to refer to \\nthe swelling that muscles undergo during a workout. The \\npump occurs because when muscles contract repeatedly \\nthey create metabolic waste products that draw water \\ninto the muscle. The greater water volume increases \\nthe overall size of the muscle cells. This can lead to \\ntemporary increases in total muscle size of one to two \\ninches. The pump typically lasts until the metabolic \\nwaste products have been cleared from the muscle.\\nquads—A slang term referring to the quadriceps muscles \\non the front thigh.\\nrange of motion (ROM)—The range through which a joint \\ncan be moved, usually its range of flexion and extension. \\nExercises also have a specific range of motion that \\ninvolves the movement from start to finish.\\nrep—Slang term for repetition.\\nrepetition—Refers to a single execution of an exercise. For \\nexample, if you curl a barbell through the entire range \\nof motion once from start to finish, you have completed \\none repetition (rep) of the movement.\\nrepetition speed—The length of time it takes to complete \\none rep.\\nresistance—The amount of weight used in an exercise. \\nSometimes referred to as intensity.\\nresting metabolic rate (RMR) —The metabolic rate mea -\\nsured under conditions of rest. This is the minimal \\nnumber of calories a person will need during a day to \\nmaintain body weight.\\nrest interval—The brief pause lasting between 30 seconds \\nand 2 minutes, and in some cases even longer, which \\noccurs between sets to allow the body to partially recu-\\nperate before initiating the succeeding set.\\nripped—A term that means a body has clearly visible \\nmuscles and very little fat.\\nroutine —A term that refers to an individual training \\nprogram.\\nRMR—See resting metabolic rate.\\nset—A group of consecutive repetitions of an exercise that \\nare performed without resting.\\nsingle-joint exercise—See isolation exercise.\\nsix-pack—A slang term used to refer to defined abdomi -\\nnal muscles. The term is used because most people’s \\nabdominal muscles create six bulges (three per side) \\nwhen they are well developed and body fat levels are low.\\nslow-twitch muscle fiber—A type of muscle fiber that has \\nhigh endurance capacity and poor ability to generate \\nquick, powerful contractions.'),\n",

The most basic split \\nroutine is done four days per week. The most popular \\ntype of split routine involves dividing the body into three \\nparts, which are worked over three consecutive days, \\nfollowed by a rest day and a repeat of the routine on day \\nfive. This is called a three-on and one-off split.\\nspotter—A training partner or a person who gives assis -\\ntance to a lifter while the lifter is performing an exercise. \\nThe purpose of the spotter is to be on hand in case the \\nlifter fails to complete a rep. In this case, the spotter \\ncan help the lifter complete the rep, which allows the \\nlifter to train past muscle failure as well as avoid injury \\non dangerous exercises such as the bench press.\\nstabilizer muscles—Muscles that assist in the performance \\nof an exercise by steadying the joint or limb being moved \\nbut not increasing the force applied to move the weight.\\nstaggered grip—A grip in which the left and right hand have \\nopposite styles of grip. One hand uses an underhand grip \\nwhile the other uses an overhand grip. This is a common \\ngrip used during the deadlift because the alternated \\ngripping allows for stronger grip strength.\\nstatic stretch—A low-force, long-duration stretch that holds \\nthe desired muscle at the greatest possible length for \\n20 to 30 seconds.\\nsticking point—The point in an exercise where the muscle \\nis at its weakest.\\nstriations—Fine grooves or bands on the surface of a \\nmuscle. The grooves are caused by the molecular \\nmachinery of the muscle fibers that are visible through \\nthe skin in ripped bodybuilders.\\nsupination—Rotating the wrist outward.\\nsupine—Lying horizontally on the back.\\nsynergist—A muscle that assists in the performance of an \\nexercise by adding to the force required for executing \\nthe movement. For example, the triceps muscle is a \\nsynergist to the pectoralis muscles during the bench \\npress exercise.\\ntendon—A band of dense white fibrous tissue that con -\\nnects a muscle to a bone. The movement of the bone is \\nproduced by the transmission of force from the muscle \\nthrough the tendon to the bone.\\ntestosterone—The primary natural androgenic and ana -\\nbolic steroid hormone produced primarily by the testes \\nin the male. It is also produced in smaller quantities by \\nthe adrenal glands in both males and females. Testos-\\nterone is the hormone responsible for maintenance of \\nmuscle mass and strength as well as the development \\nof secondary male sexual characteristics such as a deep \\nvoice, body and facial hair, and male pattern baldness.\\ntraining log—A log that a lifter keeps for recording work -\\nouts. The information recorded usually includes exer -\\ncises performed, weight used, number of sets performed, \\nnumber of reps completed per set, amount of rest taken \\nbetween sets, how the lifter felt during or after exercises, \\nand what the lifter ate before and after the workout. This \\ninformation helps the lifter assess progress and stay \\nmotivated to reach goals.\\ntraining partner —A person who trains with you on the \\nmajority of your training days.\\ntraps—A slang term for the trapezius muscles.\\ntris—A slang term referring to the triceps muscles.\\nunderhand grip—The opposite of an overhand grip. The \\nlifter should grip the barbell or dumbbell with the hands \\nunder the bar.\\nvascularity—The visibility of veins through the skin.\\nvolume training—The use of a very high number sets for \\neach bodypart.\\nwarm-up—Before any workout it is important to gradually \\nprepare the body through low-intensity exercise. This \\nhelps to get the heart rate elevated so that oxygen \\nuptake and blood flow to muscle tissue are enhanced. \\nIt also increases body temperature, which enhances the \\nmobility of joints and the contractibility of muscle fibers. \\nGood warm-up exercises include walking on a treadmill, \\nriding a stationary cycle, doing light calisthenics, and \\ndoing lightweight lifting slowly and rhythmically.\\nwashboard abs—a slang term used to describe ripped abs.\\nweight belt—A wide belt usually made of leather or nylon \\nthat is worn tightly around the waist to help support \\nthe low back and increase abdominal pressure. This \\nis supposed to help prevent back injury and increase \\nstrength. Today it is recommended that belts be worn \\nonly during exercise training in which near-maximal \\nweights are being lifted.\\nweightlifting gloves—Gloves made of leather or synthetic \\nmaterials are often worn during weightlifting to aid in the \\ngrip and prevent calluses from developing on the palms.\\nworking set—The set performed after finishing the warm-up \\nsets.\\nworkout—A single training session.\\nwrist straps—Strips of material (often canvas, nylon, or \\nleather) that are about 2 inches (5 centimeters) wide and \\n12 inches (30.5 centimeters) long with a looped end. \\nThey are wrapped around the wrist and the bar or handle \\nthat the lifter is holding onto to increase grip strength.\\nwrist wraps —Bands of elastic material that are tightly \\nwrapped around the wrists to support them during heavy \\nlifting or while performing exercises that place a high \\namount of stress on the wrists.'),\n",

As early as 2000 b.c.e., the \\nancient Egyptians lifted sacks of sand to strength-\\ntrain for hunting and military duty. According to \\nmilitary records, the Chinese also used strength \\ntraining for their military personnel as early as \\n700 b.c.e. But the historical association that most \\npeople are familiar with is the ancient Greeks. \\nMany of the athletes who competed in the ancient \\nOlympics lifted heavy stones to develop strength \\nand boost their athletic performance. Besides \\nthose functional results, strength training provided \\nthe development of a muscular physique. This \\nmasculine physique was honored in classic Greek \\nart and writing. In fact, it may be the ancient Greek \\nculture’s celebration of muscle that is responsible \\nfor spawning the modern sport of bodybuilding. \\nSeveral famous athletes during that period, such \\nas Milo and Heracles, often performed feats of \\nstrength and displayed their muscularity to spec-\\ntators. In the 19th century, the appreciation by \\nthe masses for heavily muscled physiques made \\ncelebrities out of many performing strongmen of \\nthat time. The most famous was Eugen Sandow, \\nwho is considered the father of bodybuilding.\\nDespite the fact that humans have a longstand-\\ning fascination with strength and muscularity, the \\nconcept of strength training is one that few have \\nfamiliarized themselves with. Even during the \\nfitness boom of the 1970s in the United States, \\nmost Americans participated in some form of \\naerobic exercise but neglected the strength com-\\nponent of physical fitness. Over the years, with \\nhelp from pioneers of strength training (such as \\nBob Hoffman, Joe Weider, and Charles Atlas) and \\nthrough advances in research on the developing \\nscience of resistance training, strength became \\nviewed as a necessary component of physical fit-\\nness and athletic performance. And participation \\nin strength training grew faster than participation \\nin any other physical activity.\\nAs the popularity of strength training grew, so \\ndid awareness that this practice was a complicated \\nscience that participants must fully understand in \\norder to reap the true benefits. That is why part I \\nof this book is so important for anyone interested \\nin strength training at any level. Unless you clearly \\nunderstand the principles of strength training, you \\nwill never fully comprehend how to implement an \\neffective strength training program.\\nSo before you skip ahead to one of the strength \\ntraining programs in parts II, III, and IV , be sure \\nyou have a decent grasp of the fundamentals \\npresented in these first four chapters. Armed \\nwith this background, you will have a much fuller \\nunderstanding of the exercises, techniques, and \\nprograms presented in the other chapters. You \\nalso will be more capable of individualizing these \\ntechniques to create specialized programs for \\nyourself and for others.'),\n",

Most are interested \\nin gaining muscle strength and muscle mass with \\na concomitant loss of body fat. In addition, many \\npeople expect these physical adaptations to carry \\nover into improvements in performance of athletic \\nendeavors and daily life activities. Strength train-\\ning can provide these adaptations as long as you \\nfollow certain principles, which are discussed here \\nto help you realize your strength training goals. \\nThese principles are integral to understanding how \\nstrength training works, how to individualize it to \\nmeet your needs and goals, and how to change it \\nto continue making adaptations as you progress.\\nIn addition to understanding the concepts of \\nstrength training, you must be familiar with the \\nterminology that is often used in discussions of \\nstrength training. Having the ability to understand \\nand use this lexicon will help you to learn the fun-\\ndamentals of strength training and to communicate \\nwith others who participate in strength training. To \\nfamiliarize yourself with this vocabulary, refer to \\nthe glossary at the end of this book.\\nBefore we can discuss the principles of strength \\ntraining, we must define the major terms that will \\nbe discussed throughout this book. First and fore-\\nmost is the actual term \\nstrength training. If you’ve \\ndone a fair share of reading on the topic of strength \\ntraining—be it on the Internet, in magazines, or \\nin other books—you’ve probably discovered that \\nthe terms \\nstrength training,\\xa0weight training, and \\nresistance training are often used interchangeably. \\nWhile there are definite similarities in the three \\nterms, a more precise interpretation of the defini-\\ntions points out the differences. Resistance train-\\ning is the broadest of the three terms. It describes \\nany type of training in which the body must move \\nin some direction against some type of force that \\nresists that movement. This could include lifting \\nfree weights, pushing against a hydraulic appara-\\ntus, or running up a set of stairs. \\nStrength training \\nis a type of resistance training (although not all \\ntypes of resistance training are strength training). \\nSpecifically, strength training refers to any type \\nof training that involves the body moving in some \\ndirection against a force that specifically induces \\nchanges in muscle strength or hypertrophy (muscle \\ngrowth). This could include lifting free weights or \\nmoving against a hydraulic apparatus, but not \\nrunning up a set of stairs. \\nWeight training is also \\na type of resistance training and can be a type of \\nstrength training. By strict terms of its definition, \\nit refers to any type of training in which the body \\nmoves in some direction against a force that \\nresists that movement and is supplied by some \\ntype of weight. This could include free weights and \\nweight machines but not training with a hydraulic \\napparatus or running up a set of stairs. See table \\n1.1 for a list of training methods that are catego-\\nrized under each of these types of training.\\nThis book covers strength training (most of it will \\nbe weight training), because it best describes the \\ntypes of training that we are interested in—exer -\\ncise that involves the body moving against a force \\nin an effort to induce changes in muscle strength \\nor hypertrophy.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength4\\nDEFINITIONS OF STRENGTH\\nThe basic definition of strength is the maximal \\namount of force a muscle or muscle group can \\ngenerate in a specified movement pattern at a \\nspecified velocity (speed) of movement (Knuttgen \\nand Kraemer 1987). But defining strength is not \\nthat simple. That’s because strength has many \\nmanifestations. The following definitions are all \\nforms of strength.\\nabsolute strength—The maximal amount of force \\na muscle can produce when all inhibitory and \\nprotective mechanisms are removed. Because \\nof this, it is rare that a person could ever demon-\\nstrate his or her \\nabsolute strength. This can \\ntake place only under extreme measures such \\nas during an emergency, under hypnosis, or with \\ncertain ergogenic aids.\\nmaximal strength—The maximal amount of force \\na muscle or muscle groups can produce in a \\nspecific exercise for one repetition. This is also \\nreferred to as \\none-repetition maximum, or 1RM. \\nSome estimate that the 1RM usually amounts \\nto only about 80 percent of absolute strength. \\nThis type of strength is important for powerlifters.\\nrelative strength—The ratio between a person’s \\nmaximal strength and his or her body weight. \\nThis is important when comparing the strength \\nof athletes who are much different in body size. \\nRelative strength is determined by dividing the \\n1RM by the body weight of the person. For \\nexample, a 200-pound (91-kilogram) athlete who \\ncan bench-press 400 pounds (400 ÷ 200 = 2) \\nhas the same relative strength as a 100-pound \\n(45-kilogram) athlete who can bench-press 200 \\npounds (200 ÷ 100 = 2). This type of strength is \\nimportant for powerlifters as well as for football \\nplayers and other strength athletes who are often \\ncompared with other teammates as a means of \\npredicting performance on the field.\\nspeed strength—The ability to move the body or \\nan object quickly. This term is more commonly \\nknown as \\npower. This type of strength is import-\\nant for most sports but is most critical in track \\nand field events such as the shot put, javelin, \\nand long jump.\\nstarting strength—The ability to generate a sharp \\nrise in power during the initial phase of the \\nmovement. This type of strength is important in \\nOlympic weightlifting, deadlifts, boxing, martial \\narts, and offensive line positions in football, \\nwhere strength must be generated immediately.\\nacceleration strength—The ability to continue the \\nsharp rise in power throughout most of the move-\\nment of the exercise. This type of strength takes \\nover after starting strength and is important for \\nsports such as judo, wrestling, and sprinting.\\nendurance strength—The ability to maintain force \\nproduction for a longer time or through multiple \\nrepetitions of an exercise. This type of strength \\nis important in wrestling, cycling, swimming, and \\ntraining for bodybuilding.\\nTABLE 1.1 Categories and Methods of Training\\nType of training Sample training methods\\nResistance training Free weights (including common objects)\\nWeight machines (linear guided, cable or pulley system, cam based)\\nHydraulic machines\\nPneumatic machines\\nIsokinetic machines\\nBody-weight training\\nSled dragging\\nParachute running\\nStrength training Free weights (including common objects)\\nWeight machines (linear guided, cable or pulley system, cam based)\\nHydraulic machines\\nPneumatic machines\\nBody-weight training\\nWeight training Free weights (including common objects)\\nWeight machines (linear guided, cable or pulley system, cam based)\\nwww.ebook777.com'),\n",

Each of \\nthese types of strength is developed with the use \\nof resistance of some type, be it free weights, \\nmachines, or body weight. Although this book \\nfocuses on strength training for muscle mass and \\nstrength, as well as fat loss, other muscle adap-\\ntations can take place with the use of strength \\ntraining.\\nTYPES OF MUSCLE ACTION\\nDuring a typical strength training session, muscles \\nmay contract from tens to hundreds of times to \\nmove the body or the implement they are training \\nwith. Neural stimulation of the muscle causes \\nthe contractile units of the muscle to attempt to \\nshorten. But contraction does not always involve \\nshortening of the muscle fibers. Depending on \\nthe load and the amount of force supplied by the \\nmuscle, three different muscle actions may occur \\nduring a muscle contraction (see figure 1.1):\\n1. Concentric muscle action.  This type of \\nmuscle action occurs when the muscle \\nforce exceeds the external resistance, \\nresulting in joint movement as the muscle \\nshortens. In other words, concentric con-\\ntractions are those in which the muscle \\nfibers shorten while contracting to lift the \\nweight. This is demonstrated by the upward \\nphase of a biceps curl and is often referred \\nto as the positive phase of the repetition.\\n2. Eccentric muscle action. This type of muscle \\naction occurs when the external resistance \\nexceeds the force supplied by the muscle, \\nresulting in joint movement as the muscle \\nlengthens. Eccentric muscle actions are \\ndemonstrated by the downward phase of \\nthe biceps curl. This is often referred to as \\nthe negative portion of the repetition. Even \\nthough the fibers are lengthening, they’re \\nalso in a state of contraction, permitting \\nthe weight to return to the starting position \\nin a controlled manner.\\n3. Isometric muscle action.  This type of \\nmuscle action occurs when the muscle \\ncontracts without moving, generating force \\nwhile its length remains static . Isometric \\nmuscle actions are demonstrated in an \\nattempt to lift an immovable object or \\nan object that is too heavy to move. The \\nmuscle fibers contract in an attempt to \\nmove the weight, but the muscle does \\nnot shorten in overall length because the \\nobject is too heavy to move.\\nEccentric:\\nmuscle lengthens\\nIsometric:\\nmuscle length\\nis unchanged\\nConcentric:\\nmuscle shortens\\nFIGURE 1.1  Major types of muscle actions: concentric, \\nisometric, and eccentric.\\nAmong strength training scientists there is much \\ndebate about the importance of each of these \\ntypes of muscle actions regarding increases in \\nstrength and muscle mass. Studies have been con-\\nducted in an effort to determine whether one type \\nof muscle action is most important for enhancing \\nmuscle strength and mass. Because it is possible \\nto produce greater force during eccentric and iso-\\nmetric muscle actions as compared to concentric \\nmuscle actions, it has been hypothesized that \\nthese muscle actions may be more important than \\nconcentric muscle actions for inducing changes in \\nmuscle strength and size.\\nResearchers have found that training with \\nisometric muscle actions can increase muscle \\nstrength and size (Fleck and Schutt 1985). How-\\never, the strength gains from isometric training \\nare realized only during the specific joint angles at \\nwhich the muscles were trained. In other words, if \\nsomeone trains isometrically on the bench press \\nat the point halfway between the start and finish,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength6\\nthat person will gain muscle strength only at that \\nspecific point in the exercise. This would not \\nequate to greater overall strength in the bench \\npress unless a variety of joint angles between the \\nstart and finish were also trained isometrically. \\nTherefore, while isometric training can be bene -\\nficial, concentric and eccentric muscle actions \\nshould also be included for better overall muscle \\nadaptations. For a sample training program that \\nuses isometric muscle actions, see Static Strength \\nTraining in chapter 9.\\nBecause it is possible to overload a muscle \\nmore during eccentric muscle contractions, these \\ncontractions cause more muscle damage. It has \\nbeen hypothesized that this greater overload can \\ninduce greater gains in strength. Indeed, research \\nhas shown that eccentric-only training does induce \\nsignificant strength gains; however, this training \\nappears to offer no greater strength benefit than \\nconcentric-only training. Therefore, to maximize \\nmuscle adaptations, strength training programs \\nneed to incorporate both concentric and eccentric \\nmuscle actions. For sample training programs that \\nincorporate eccentric training, see Negative Rep -\\netitions in chapter 6 and Negative-Rep Strength \\nTraining in chapter 9.\\nThe use of concentric, eccentric, and isometric \\nmuscle actions in strength training will yield some-\\nwhat different adaptations. Although isometric \\nmuscle actions can improve strength and muscle \\nsize to some degree, they provide mainly static \\nstrength. This does not necessarily carry over to \\ndynamic strength used for most sports. Therefore, \\nmost strength training programs should focus on \\nconcentric and eccentric muscle actions. Greater \\nimprovements in strength and muscle mass can be \\nachieved when repetitions include both concentric \\nand eccentric muscle actions.\\nAnother type of muscle action that should \\nbe considered here is called \\nvoluntary maximal \\nmuscle action. This type of muscle action does \\nnot refer to the actual movement of the muscle \\nbut to the intensity of the resistance. When a \\nmuscle undergoes a voluntary maximal muscle \\naction, it is moving against as much resistance \\nas its current fatigue level will allow. Regardless \\nof how many repetitions are performed in a set—\\nwhether it be 1 or 10—it is the last repetition, \\nwhen momentary concentric muscle failure is \\nreached, that is considered the voluntary maximal \\nmuscle action. In other words, not another single \\nrepetition can be performed. This is also referred \\nto as the \\nrepetition maximum\\xa0(RM) and is usually \\nrepresented with a number preceding the RM. \\nFor example, 1RM would represent the amount of \\nweight that induces a voluntary maximal muscle \\naction with one repetition. A 10RM is the amount \\nof weight that induces a voluntary maximal muscle \\naction on the 10th repetition.\\nPRINCIPLES OF STRENGTH \\nTRAINING\\nCountless principles of strength training are being \\nemployed today. But the validity of many of these \\nprinciples is questionable, because few strength \\ntraining professionals agree on the majority of \\nthem. However, there are a few principles that are \\nrevered by all strength training professionals: the \\nprinciple of specificity, the principle of progressive \\noverload, the principle of individuality, the principle \\nof variation, the principle of maintenance, and the \\nprinciple of reversibility. So important are these \\nprinciples that few would argue against their being \\nconsidered laws of strength training.\\nprinciple of specificity—One of the seminal prin -\\nciples in designing strength training programs. \\nIt is often referred to as SAID, which stands for \\n“specific adaptation to imposed demands.” In \\nits most basic definition, it means to train in a \\nspecific manner to produce a specific outcome. \\nFor instance, if the immediate goal is to increase \\n1RM strength, then training with the appropriate \\nrange of repetition, proper rest periods, and \\napposite frequency to optimize strength gains is \\na necessity. Or if the goal is to increase athletic \\nperformance in a specific sport, the exercises \\nshould mimic the types of movements performed \\nin the sport, and they should be performed at \\na similar speed as those movements. This prin-\\nciple is one of the most important in strength \\ntraining because if it is not being met, all other \\nprinciples are negated.\\nprinciple of progressive overload —The practice \\nof continually increasing the intensity of the \\nworkout as the muscle becomes accustomed \\nto that intensity level. This can be done by \\nincreasing the weight lifted, the number of repe-\\ntitions performed, or the total number of sets; or \\nit can be done by decreasing the rest between \\nsets. Continually increasing the stress placed \\non the muscle allows the muscle to increase its'),\n",

This is one of \\nthe most critical principles of strength training \\nas well as one of the earliest developed. This \\nprinciple was established just after World War II \\nby the research of DeLorme (1945) and DeLo -\\nrme and Watkins (1948). Without providing the \\nmuscles with progressive overload, continual \\nadaptations in muscle strength and size would \\ncease. For example, at the start of a strength \\ntraining program, performing three sets of 10 \\nreps on the bench press with 135 pounds may \\nbe a challenge. After several weeks of training, \\nperforming three sets of 10 reps on the bench \\npress with 135 pounds will become easy. At this \\nstage, training adaptations will cease unless \\nthe weight is increased above 135 pounds, the \\nreps are increased above 10 reps, the sets are \\nincreased to more than three, or the rest between \\nsets is decreased.\\nprinciple of individuality—The theory that any train-\\ning program must consider the specific needs or \\ngoals and abilities of the person for whom it is \\ndesigned. For example, a beginning bodybuilder \\nwith the goal of adding muscle mass would \\nhave a much different training program than an \\nadvanced bodybuilder with the same goal. The \\ndifference in their training programs is based not \\non their desired training outcomes but on their \\ntraining experiences. The advanced trainer would \\nrequire more volume and high-intensity training \\ntechniques to reach the same goal as the begin-\\nner. On the other hand, an advanced lifter who \\nhas the goal of gaining muscle mass would train \\nmuch differently than an advanced lifter with the \\ngoal of gaining muscle strength. Here the differ-\\nence in their training programs is based on their \\ndifferent goals. In general, the advanced lifter \\nwith the goal of gaining more muscle strength \\nwould train with fewer reps, heavier weight, and \\nlower volume than the advanced lifter with the \\nmuscle mass goal.\\nprinciple of variation —The simple fact that no \\nmatter how effective a program is, it will be effec-\\ntive only for a short period. Once a person has \\nexperienced the specific adaptations that a par-\\nticular training program is designed to provide, a \\nnew stimulus must be imposed on the muscles \\nor continued progress will be stagnated. This \\nis the foundation of periodization (discussed in \\nchapter 3) and is the reason that training cycles \\nmust be employed.\\nprinciple of maintenance—As a person reaches \\nhis or her goals, it takes less work to maintain \\nthat level of strength or muscle mass. If he or \\nshe is happy with that level, the frequency of \\ntraining can be reduced. This is typically a good \\ntime to involve more cross-training so that other \\nfitness components can be developed.\\nprinciple of reversibility—The fact that once the \\nstrength training program is discontinued or not \\nmaintained at the minimal level of frequency and \\nintensity, the strength or hypertrophy adaptations \\nthat were made with that program will not only \\nstop forward progression but will also revert back \\nto the starting level.\\nWARMING UP , STRETCHING, \\nAND COOLING DOWN\\nYou might have trouble finding the time to sneak \\nin a workout, let alone worry about properly warm-\\ning up before and stretching after the workout. \\nHowever, how you prepare and end your strength \\ntraining sessions can have a big impact on your \\nresults as well as your quality of life, especially as \\nyou get older. Try your best to warm up properly \\nbefore each workout and do some stretching to \\ncool down after the workout.\\nA general warm-up of 5 to 10 minutes on a tread-\\nmill or stationary bike, some calisthenics, or, better \\nyet, dynamic stretches such as high kicks and arm \\ncircles will raise your body temperature sufficiently. \\nA study by Taylor and colleagues (2011) found that \\njust a 0.3 °F increase in body temperature allowed \\nathletes to jump 6 percent higher and have 10 per-\\ncent more power. In other words, a short warm-up \\nallows you to be stronger and perform better in the \\ngym. Doing dynamic stretches as a warm-up fur -\\nther increases muscle power and strength during \\nthe warm-up. On the other hand, static stretching \\nbefore strength training may impair muscle power \\nand strength during the workout.\\nYour best bet is to save static stretching for the \\ncool-down and as a way to increase your flexibility. \\nThis form of stretching is particularly effective for \\nmaximizing flexibility when done after workouts \\nwhen the body is warmer and the muscles are more \\nfatigued.

Considering this \\ntime frame, a single workout may seem inconse -\\nquential to the overall program. Yet the design of \\neach single workout is just as important as the \\noverall program. This is because each workout \\nadds up sequentially to create the long-term train-\\ning program that will provide the adaptations that \\nthe program imparts. This chapter discusses the \\nprinciples involved in designing a single strength \\ntraining workout.\\nEvery workout is composed of at least five spe-\\ncific program variables that you can manipulate \\nin order to alter the workout: choice of exercises, \\norder of exercises, number of sets, resistance, \\nand rest taken between sets. You must carefully \\nchoose these variables to get a workout that is \\nappropriate for your level of fitness and that initi-\\nates the desired adaptations.\\nAlthough strength athletes such as Olympic \\nweightlifters, powerlifters, and bodybuilders have \\nmanipulated these variables for many years, William \\nJ. Kraemer, PhD, is credited with scientifically deter-\\nmining and recording what he has termed the five \\nspecific clusters of acute program variables (see \\ntable 2.1). The systematic alteration of these acute \\nvariables results in the periodized training program.\\nCHOICE OF EXERCISES\\nWhile all acute variables of a program are criti -\\ncal to a person’s progress, choice of exercise is \\narguably one of the most critical. The reasoning \\nbehind this is that if you are not training the appro-\\npriate muscle groups, then all other variables are \\nsomewhat meaningless. Simply put, muscles that \\nare not trained will not benefit from the program. \\nTherefore, choosing the proper exercises for each \\nworkout is the first step in creating an effective \\nstrength program.\\nTABLE 2.1 Program Design Details\\nVariable Specifics\\nChoice of \\nexercises\\nPrimary exercises\\nAssistance exercises\\nMultijoint exercises\\nSingle-joint exercises\\nExercise equipment\\nOrder of \\nexercises\\nPrimary exercises followed by \\nassistance exercises\\nLarger muscle groups followed by \\nsmaller muscle groups\\nLagging muscle groups trained first\\nStraight sets for each exercise\\nSupersets\\nNumber of \\nsets\\nVolume effects\\nSingle sets\\nMultiple sets\\nNumber of sets performed per exercise\\nNumber of sets performed per muscle \\ngroup\\nNumber of sets performed per workout\\nResistance \\n(intensity)\\nPercentage of 1RM\\nRM target zone\\nOMNI-resistance exercise scale\\nRest period \\nbetween \\nsets\\nDependent on resistance used\\nDependent on muscle adaptation \\ndesired\\nDependent on metabolic pathway \\nbeing trained\\nDependent on training technique\\nAdapted from S.J.

For competitive athletes, \\nthe primary exercises not only should target the \\nsame muscle groups that are used in competi -\\ntion but should also include some exercises that \\nmimic the movements performed in their sports. \\nFor example, the primary exercises for an Olympic \\nweightlifter are the clean and jerk and the snatch; \\nfor a powerlifter they are the bench press, squat, \\nand deadlift; for an offensive lineman they are the \\nsquat and incline bench press.\\nPrimary exercises usually are multijoint move -\\nments such as the bench press, squat, and \\ndeadlift. These exercises require the coordinated \\nuse of multiple muscle groups. Because several \\nlarge muscle groups are used in performing these \\nexercises, they tend to be the ones in which the \\nmost weight can be lifted. For instance, the world \\nrecords in the deadlift and the squat are well over \\n900 and 1,100 pounds (408 and 499 kilograms), \\nrespectively. The world record in the barbell biceps \\ncurl (although this is not a lift that is sanctioned by \\nany powerlifting federation), a single-joint exercise \\n(typically referred to as an assistance exercise), \\nis not much more than 400 pounds (181 kilo -\\ngrams). Because the primary exercises call for \\ngreat strength and coordination, they should be \\nperformed early in the workout when the muscle \\ngroups are the least fatigued.\\nAssistance exercises typically are single-joint \\nexercises such as the biceps curl, triceps exten-\\nsion, and deltoid lateral raise. These exercises \\noften involve only a single muscle group. Because \\nonly one muscle group is working to lift the weight, \\nthese exercises usually involve much lighter \\nweight than primary exercises do. For power -\\nlifters and other strength athletes, assistance \\nexercises are usually done toward the end of the \\nworkout after the major muscle groups are fairly \\nfatigued from performing the primary exercises. \\nAn exception to the rule that most assistance \\nexercises are single-joint exercises is core train -\\ning. Training the core (the deep muscles in the \\nabdominal cavity and lower back) involves com -\\nplicated movement patterns that involve multiple \\njoints and force the core musculature to work at \\nstabilizing the body.\\nFor those interested in building muscle size, all \\nexercises also can be divided into multijoint and \\nsingle-joint exercises. However, the terms used in \\nbodybuilding circles are \\nmultijoint and isolation \\nexercises. Isolation implies that the single-joint \\nmovement is isolating the major muscle group and \\nforcing it to perform all the work in that exercise \\nwithout the help from other muscle groups. An \\nexample of this is the leg extension. While most \\nmajor muscle groups have both multijoint and \\nisolation exercises that target them, the biceps, \\nforearms, calves, and abdominals are muscle \\ngroups that are trained usually with just isolation \\nexercises. For a list of multijoint and isolation \\nexercises for most major muscle groups, refer to \\ntable 2.3.\\nTABLE 2.2 Primary and Assistance \\nExercises\\nPrimary exercises Assistance exercises\\nPower clean\\nDeadlift\\nSquat\\nLeg press\\nBench press\\nMilitary press\\nBarbell row\\nPull-up\\nKnee extension\\nLeg curl\\nChest fly\\nDeltoid lateral raise\\nBiceps curl\\nTriceps extension\\nWrist curl\\nCalf raise\\nAbdominal crunch\\nTABLE 2.3 Multijoint and Isolation Exercises\\nMuscle \\ngroup Multijoint exercises Isolation exercises\\nChest Bench press\\nDumbbell bench \\npress\\nDumbbell fly\\nCable crossover\\nShoulders Barbell overhead \\npress\\nUpright row\\nLateral raise\\nFront raise\\nTriceps Close-grip bench \\npress\\nDips\\nTriceps pressdown\\nLying triceps \\nextension\\nBiceps Barbell curl\\nSeated incline curl\\nForearms Wrist curl\\nReverse wrist curl\\nQuadriceps Squat\\nLeg press\\nLeg extension\\nHamstrings Squat\\nDeadlift\\nLeg curl\\nRomanian deadlift\\nCalves Standing calf raise\\nSeated calf raise\\nAbdominals Crunch\\nReverse crunch'),\n",

Here, the use \\nof a cable apparatus or resistance tubing would \\nbe a better exercise choice. Choosing appropriate \\nstrength training equipment is discussed in more \\ndetail in chapter 4.\\nORDER OF EXERCISES\\nHow the specific exercises that make up a single \\nworkout are ordered will determine not only the \\neffectiveness of the workout but also the particular \\nadaptations that the program imparts. Therefore, \\nthe order in which exercises are performed must \\ncorrespond with the specific training goals.\\nIn training for strength, the primary exercises are \\nperformed first in the workout relative to assistance \\nexercises. The logic behind this is the fact that \\nprimary exercises typically involve numerous large \\nmuscle groups working together to lift relatively \\nheavy weight. Therefore, these exercises must be \\ndone early enough in the program that fatigue is \\nnot an issue. Performing single-joint exercises first \\nwill compromise the amount of weight a person can \\nlift on the primary exercises and may even make \\nthe person more susceptible to injury, because \\nform tends to suffer when muscles are fatigued.\\nIf building muscle size is the primary goal, then \\nmultijoint exercises should be performed first \\nwith isolation exercises performed later in the \\nworkout. The multijoint exercises help to build \\nmuscle size because it is possible to train with \\nheavier weight on them. An exception to this rule \\ninvolves a common bodybuilding technique known \\nas preexhaust. This technique involves the use of \\nsingle-joint exercises before multijoint exercises \\nin an effort to exhaust a particular muscle group \\nso that it becomes the weak link in the multijoint \\nexercise. This concept is discussed in detail in \\nchapter 6.\\nIf multiple muscle groups are trained in a work-\\nout, such as in whole-body workouts, and only one \\nexercise per major muscle group is performed, \\nthen ordering exercises involves determining the \\nmost critical muscle groups based on the goals of \\nthe person. Typically, larger-sized muscle groups \\n(such as the legs and back) are trained before \\nsmaller muscle groups (such as the shoulders and \\nbiceps) for the same reason mentioned previously: \\nLarger muscle groups need to be trained before \\nfatigue is an issue.\\nNUMBER OF SETS\\nA set is a grouping of repetitions that is followed \\nby a rest interval. The number of sets performed \\nin a workout is one of the factors affecting the \\ntotal volume (sets \\ue033 repetitions \\ue033 resistance) of \\nexercise. Therefore, it must be consistent not only \\nwith the individual’s strength goals but also with \\nhis or her current level of fitness.\\nGenerally speaking, it is accepted that multiple \\nsets are more beneficial for developing strength \\nand muscle mass. In fact, this stance is supported \\nin guidelines set by the National Strength and \\nConditioning Association (Pearson et al. 2000) \\nand the American College of Sports Medicine \\n(Kraemer et al. 2002). Single sets are effective \\nfor building strength for beginning weightlifters \\nor for maintaining strength during periods when \\nit is necessary or desired to reduce the volume \\nperformed. Beginners starting with a single-set \\nprogram should progressively increase the number \\nof sets to make continued adaptations in strength.\\nWhen designing a workout, one should consider \\nthe number of sets performed per exercise, the \\nnumber of sets per muscle group, and the total \\nnumber of sets for the workout. The number of \\nsets per exercise typically varies depending on \\nthe strength training program. Most programs \\ndesigned for the intermediate to advanced weight \\ntrainer incorporate between three and six sets per \\nexercise. This set range is considered optimal for \\nincreasing strength. How many sets one should \\nperform per muscle group is a question that is \\nmost applicable to bodybuilding-type training, in \\nwhich numerous exercises are performed for each \\nmuscle group. This is in opposition to strength train-\\ning programs for conditioning athletes, which may \\ntypically involve only one exercise per major muscle \\ngroup. The number of sets per muscle group may \\nrange from 3 to 24 but ultimately depends on the \\nnumber of exercises performed for that muscle \\ngroup, the number of muscle groups trained in that \\nworkout, the intensity used, and where the person \\nis in his or her training cycle. The total number of'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength12\\nsets performed for a workout may vary from about \\n10 to 40, depending on the type of training and the \\nnumber of sets per exercise. Care must be taken \\nso that not too many total sets are performed, \\nparticularly when intensity is high, since these vari-\\nables greatly influence total work. Performing too \\nmuch total work over time stresses the body and \\ncan lead to overtraining in the long run. Although \\ndefining how much work is too much is a difficult \\ntask because many factors are involved, such as \\nthe person’s training experience and genetics, \\ngeneral recommendations can be made. Typically \\ndoing more than 20 sets per muscle group for an \\nextended period can lead to overtraining. In addi-\\ntion, doing more than 40 sets per workout, even \\nwhen multiple muscle groups are trained in that \\nworkout, can lead to overtraining if done too fre -\\nquently or if proper nutrition is not being followed.\\nAs for any other acute variables of training, \\nthe number of sets should be manipulated to \\nprevent stagnation of training adaptations. The \\nmost important variable of training that influences \\nthe number of sets that should be performed is \\nintensity (the amount of weight lifted). The greater \\nthe intensity, the greater the stress placed on the \\nmuscle, and thus the lower the number of sets that \\nshould be performed. Therefore, the total number \\nof sets in a training cycle should vary inversely with \\ntraining intensity. In fact, training with too many \\ntotal sets can be detrimental to the adaptations \\nof strength training and lead to overtraining.\\nRESISTANCE\\nThe term intensity refers to the amount of weight \\nlifted (or resistance used) on a particular set. Alter-\\nnatively, many bodybuilders use intensity to refer \\nto the difficulty of a set or a workout, regardless of \\nthe amount of weight used. For example, a body-\\nbuilder may perform a high-intensity set involving \\nvery light weight at extremely high repetitions until \\nmuscle failure is reached. The intensity of that \\nset would be even higher if the spotter helped the \\nbodybuilder get three extra forced reps at the end \\nof that set. However, according to the formal defi-\\nnition of \\nintensity, that set would be categorized \\nas low intensity. Therefore, to avoid confusion, the \\nterm \\nresistance will be used when referring to the \\namount of weight used.\\nThe resistance used is one of the most import-\\nant variables in a training program, ranking second \\nonly to exercise choice. The amount of resistance \\nused for a set is inversely related to the number \\nof repetitions performed. That is, the heavier \\nthe weight, the fewer the repetitions that can be \\nperformed. One of the most common ways that \\nresistance is measured is through the use of a \\npercentage of the repetition maximum (RM). For \\nexample, an exercise can be prescribed at 80 \\npercent of the individual’s 1RM.\\nIf, for instance, the person’s 1RM on the bench \\npress is 300 pounds (136 kilograms), then\\n300 pounds \\ue033 .80 = 240 pounds\\nUsing this method does require frequent 1RM \\ntesting to ensure that accurate training resistance \\nis used. This method may be desirable for certain \\nstrength athletes because recurrent testing is a \\ncommonly used measure of an athlete’s progress \\nand a predictor of preparedness for competition. \\nOlympic weightlifters should use this method reg-\\nularly because of the skill component required for \\nthat type of lifting. Competitive weightlifters must \\nuse precisely measured resistance for their train-\\ning phases. Powerlifters also commonly use this \\nmethod because the defining moment in their sport \\nis the amount of weight they can perform at 1RM \\non the bench press, squat, and deadlift. However, \\nmany top powerlifters train with percentages that \\nare based on the 1RM they are predicting to lift in \\ncompetition. The down side to prescribing exercise \\nintensity with RM percentages is the fact that the \\namount of reps you can perform at a certain per -\\ncentage of 1RM can vary depending on experience, \\nthe muscle group being trained, and the exercise \\nequipment used.\\nFor bodybuilders and other fitness enthusiasts, \\nfrequent testing of 1RM is not convenient or often \\nfeasible. It would be too time consuming because \\nof the larger number of exercises they typically use. \\nIn addition, many of the exercises they perform are \\nnot conducive to 1RM testing. Although charts are \\ndevised for estimating 1RM based on the number \\nof reps that can be completed at a certain weight, \\nthese are far from accurate. For serious weight \\ntrainers, an RM target zone is the easiest way \\nto monitor training resistance. This is depicted \\nas 10RM or 5RM and refers to a resistance that \\nlimits them to that number of repetitions. As their \\nstrength increases, they simply move to a heavier \\nweight but shoot for the same RM goal. This allows \\nthem to continually stay in the repetition range \\nthey are shooting for without the need to test their \\n1RM. Worth mentioning here is that many strength'),\n",

They \\nbelieve that muscle can be trained for only one \\ngoal in any acute situation. Yet bodybuilders often \\ntrain with a wide range of repetitions in a single \\nworkout. For example, they may do one set of an \\nexercise with a very heavy weight for 5 to 7 reps \\nand follow it with another set with light weight for \\nreps in the 15 to 20 range.\\nA more recently developed method of prescrib-\\ning and monitoring resistance involves the use of \\nthe OMNI-resistance exercise scale (Robertson \\net al. 2003; Robertson 2004). This is a 10-point \\nsubjective scale (see figure 2.1) that is a modified \\nversion of the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) \\nscale that was originally described by Borg (1982) \\nand used mostly for monitoring aerobic exercise. \\nEach value from 1 to 10 on the OMNI represents \\napproximately a 10 percent increase in repetition \\nmaximum. For example, the use of 100 percent \\nof a person’s 1RM elicits a rating of 10 on the \\nOMNI-resistance exercise scale, while the use of \\n50 percent of the person’s 1RM corresponds to a \\nrating of 5 on the scale. The OMNI-resistance exer-\\ncise scale is not a precise quantitative scale but \\nmore a qualitative scale that determines how hard \\nthe weight feels to the lifter. For this reason, it is \\nbest used by trainers who are prescribing strength \\ntraining to inexperienced lifters.\\nToday, thanks to the many years of trial and \\nerror by athletes and the numerous research \\nstudies to confirm the original inclinations, it is \\nnow well established that using certain resistance \\nintensities provides corresponding results. This \\ninformation can be used in designing a repetition \\nmaximum continuum as seen in figure 2.2. This \\nfigure is a modification of the continuum devised \\nby Fleck and Kraemer (2004) that is recognized \\nas the most acceptable by exercise scientists \\nand strength coaches. The continuum in figure \\n2.2 ranges in maximal repetitions from 1 to 25, \\nas does the original, but adds the adaptation \\nof muscle hypertrophy. On the lower end of the \\ncontinuum, strength gains are more pronounced, \\nparticularly when using maximal repetitions in the \\nrange of 1 to 6, or about 80 to 100 percent of 1RM \\n(O’Shea 1966; Weiss, Coney, and Clark 1999). \\nEnhanced muscle hypertrophy is most notable \\nwhen training with repetition maximums in the 8 \\nto 12 range, which corresponds to about 70 to 80 \\npercent 1RM (Kraemer, Fleck, and Evans 1996). \\nAnd muscular endurance benefits occur when repe-\\ntition maximums of 12 and above, or 70 percent \\nof 1RM and below, are used (Stone and Coulter \\n1994). New evidence also suggests that these \\nFIGURE 2.1 OMNI-resistance exercise scale.\\nReprinted from R.J.

This is because each \\nadaptation is related to the others. For example, \\nincreasing both maximal strength and muscle \\nendurance beneficially affects muscle hypertrophy. \\nSo while the person should spend the majority of \\ntraining time using the repetition range that best \\nfits his or her major goals, the periodic cycling of \\nother intensities will enhance this goal.\\nOne major assumption that the continuum of \\nrepetition maximums makes is that all repeti -\\ntions are performed at a moderate speed. Yet the \\nspeed of a rep can be increased or decreased, \\nparticularly at light to moderate loads. And this \\nchange in speed will dramatically alter the muscle \\nadaptations. In general, fast repetition speeds \\nwith very light weight are best for building speed \\nstrength, or power, when few repetitions are per-\\nformed. In contrast, slow to moderate repetitions \\nwith a submaximal weight are better for producing \\nadaptations in muscle endurance and hypertro -\\nphy as the time the muscle is under tension is \\nincreased. As an example, using a weight that is \\nabout 30 to 45 percent of 1RM to do three reps \\nas fast as possible builds speed strength (power) \\nand has little effect if any on muscle hypertrophy \\nor endurance.\\nREST PERIOD BETWEEN SETS\\nHow long a weightlifter should rest between sets is \\ndependent on numerous factors. These include the \\nresistance being used, the goals of the lifter, and \\nthe metabolic pathways that need to be trained. \\nThe general consensus is that the lower the reps \\nbeing performed (that is, the higher the resistance \\nintensity), the longer the rest periods that should \\nbe taken. And so as the periodized routine alters \\nresistance intensity, so too do the rest periods \\nchange accordingly.\\nIf a person is training for maximal strength \\nor power, he or she should take long rest peri -\\nods between sets. This is because lifting heavy \\nweight for low reps requires energy derived from \\nanaerobic metabolism, called the ATP-PC (ade -\\nnosine triphosphate-phosphocreatine) system. \\nThis metabolic pathway provides the immediate \\nenergy required for lifting heavy weight or perform-\\ning explosive movements for a short period. This \\nsystem requires more than 3 minutes of rest for \\nthe majority of recovery to occur. Therefore, the \\nrecommendation is to rest at least 3 to more than \\n5 minutes when training for maximal strength or \\npower. The general guidelines are as follows: resis-\\ntance at less than 5RM requires over 5 minutes of \\nrest, 5-7RM requires 3-5 minutes, 8-10RM requires \\n2-3 minutes, 11-13RM requires 1-2 minutes, and \\nover 13RM requires about 1 minute (Kraemer \\n2003). This level of rest ensures that fatigue \\nwill be minimal at the start of a new set, and in \\nturn, strength can be near maximal. Similarly, if a \\nstrength athlete or other athlete performs short \\nbouts of high-intensity exercise with long rest \\nperiods between, the athlete should rest at least \\nthree minutes between sets.\\nWhen training for muscle hypertrophy (which is \\nbest attained with reps in the range of 8 to 12), \\nshorter rest periods appear to be the most benefi-\\ncial. Resting less than three minutes between sets \\nstresses the anaerobic energy systems, and this \\nis often recommended for bodybuilding training. \\nThis is because fatigue is believed to play some \\nrole in the pathways leading to muscle growth. \\nOne possibility involves lactate, which dramatically \\nincreases as reps increase and rest between sets \\ndecreases. \\nFor athletes interested in improving muscle \\nendurance, low intensity (less than 60 percent \\n1RM), high repetitions of 15 and beyond, and short \\nrest periods (under one minute) seem to be the \\nbest plan. This plan allows them to train to the \\npoint of fatigue and beyond, which enhances the \\nRM\\nTraining\\nadaptation\\nMaximal\\nstrength\\nMuscle\\nhypertrophy\\nMuscle endurance\\nand muscle hypertrophy\\n1 2 3 4 5 6  7 8 9 10 11  12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\\nFIGURE 2.2 Continuum of repetition maximums.\\nModified from S.J.

Because fatigue is associated with muscle \\nhypertrophy, many bodybuilders also frequently use \\nthis style of training.\\nSome styles of training use such minute rest \\nperiods between sets that they are classified in \\ngym circles as using “no rest” between sets. This \\nmeans that you would take no deliberate rest but \\ninstead immediately move to the next exercise. \\nSuch training methods include circuit training \\nand the various forms of superset training, which \\nincludes compound sets, triple sets, and giant sets \\n(see chapter 6 for more detailed explanations of \\nthese methods). With each of these methods, a \\ncertain number of sets of different exercises are \\ndone back to back with no rest between exercise \\nsets. Only after you complete the prescribed \\nnumber of exercises (which can vary from 2 to as \\nmany as 12) would you take a rest period. Then \\nyou would repeat the cycle anywhere from one to \\nfive times depending on the program.\\nADDITIONAL FACTORS\\nThe five original acute training variables discussed \\nearlier were classified and organized decades ago. \\nAs with any science, progress has been made to \\nfurther our understanding of resistance training. \\nBesides determining the best exercises to use, \\nthe correct order of those exercises, the proper \\nresistance to use, the optimal number of sets to \\ndo, and the right amount of rest to take between \\nsets, other factors are to be considered.\\nAnother acute training variable that can be \\nadded to the list is repetition speed, or rep tempo. \\nGenerally speaking, typical rep speed in strength \\ntraining lasts about two to three seconds to \\ncomplete the positive (concentric) and negative \\n(eccentric) portions of each rep. This is considered \\na controlled pace and is the pace taught by most \\nstrength coaches and personal trainers. However, \\nsome programs rely on the manipulation of rep \\nspeed. Speeding up the time it takes to complete \\na rep—in the range of one second or less—has \\nbeen shown to be an effective way to increase \\nmuscle power. See Ballistic Strength Training \\nin chapter 9 for an explanation of how to train \\nwith fast, explosive reps. Some strength training \\nexperts also believe that slowing down a rep—in \\nthe range of 10 to 20 seconds—can enhance \\nmuscle endurance as well as size. Research in \\nthis area is limited, but anecdotal reports are \\npositive. See Slow-Repetition Training in chapter \\n6 for an explanation of how to train using very \\nslow reps, and see Speed-Set Training in chapter \\n6 as well.\\nAnother factor you should also be concerned \\nabout is how frequently you train. The frequency \\nat which muscle groups are trained can be more \\ncritical than any of the acute variables of training \\ndiscussed previously. The reason has to do with \\nrecovery. It is generally accepted that you should \\nwait until a muscle has recovered from a previous \\nworkout before training the muscle again. Muscle \\nrecovery, however, is an individual thing that is \\ninfluenced by factors such as lifting experience, \\nintensity of the workout, and total volume. In most \\ninstances it is best to get 2 to 7 days of rest for \\neach muscle group. This will be determined by \\nhow you split your training. \\nTraining splits refer to \\nhow you break down training days. For example, do \\nyou train your whole body during every workout, or \\ndo you train only one or two muscle groups each \\nworkout? For obvious reasons, the more workouts \\nit takes you to train all the major muscle groups \\nof the body, the more rest you will take between \\nworkouts for the same muscle group.

In designing \\nthe most effective training programs to reach your \\ngoals, you must carefully consider the choice of \\nexercises and the order, intensity used, number of \\nsets performed, and rest periods between sets. \\nIn addition to these variables, you may want to \\nconsider the speed at which you perform your \\nreps. Last but not least is the frequency at which \\nyou train muscle groups.

The original concept was \\ndeveloped in the former Eastern Bloc countries in \\nthe late 1950s to optimize athletes’ adaptations \\nto resistance training. More important, period -\\nization revolves around the athlete’s competitive \\ncalendar so that he or she is at a competitive \\npeak for competition.\\nThe basis of periodization is general adaptation \\nsyndrome (GAS), which describes three stages that \\nan organism—such as an athlete—goes through \\nwhen exposed to a novel stress (Selye 1936). As \\na new stress is placed on the body (for example, \\nheavy training in the range of three to five reps), \\nthe muscle first goes through an alarm reaction. \\nDuring this stage the athlete momentarily gets \\nweaker. But with continued exposure to the stress \\n(successive workouts), the body enters the stage \\nof adaptation. In this stage the body supercompen-\\nsates for the stress—such as increasing muscle \\nstrength—to better deal with the stress. If the body \\nis continually exposed to the same stress for too \\nlong, it may enter the stage of exhaustion, where \\nits adaptation to the stress may actually decline. \\nThis may mean that the strength gains the athlete \\nmade during the adaptation stage will cease, and \\nstagnation may set in. It may even lead to an \\nactual decline in strength. Although this theory \\nis now considered a simplistic take on the body’s \\nresponse to stress, it does hold true and explains \\nthe reason periodization is so important for proper \\nadaptation to strength training.\\nYou must expose the muscle to any one training \\nstyle for just long enough to reap the benefits but \\navoid a nosedive of those positive adaptations. \\nAt this stage a new training style should be \\nintroduced, and the cycle continues. A simplistic \\ntake on periodization is the maxim of “everything \\nworks, but nothing works forever.” This is a major \\ntheme of this book and is the reason it offers so \\nmany training methods. Having a large arsenal of \\ntraining methods (as provided in chapters 6 and \\n9) to use for short periods and continually cycling \\nthem in a systematic order will prevent stagnation \\nand maximize training adaptations.\\nThe three periodization schemes most com -\\nmonly used by strength coaches, which are the \\nthree most extensively researched, are classic \\nstrength and power periodization, reverse linear \\nperiodization, and undulating periodization. \\nAlthough there are many other more obscure \\nperiodization schemes out there, a discussion \\nincluding these three will cover the premise \\nbehind periodization. Regardless of the exact \\nplan, periodized strength training programs have \\nbeen shown through research to be significantly \\nmore effective than nonperiodized programs for \\nincreasing strength, power, and athletic perfor -\\nmance in both men and women (Kraemer et al. \\n2003; Marx et al. 2001; Rhea and Alderman \\n2004; Willoughby 1993).\\nCLASSIC PERIODIZATION\\nThe name implies that this system is the hallmark \\nperiodization scheme most associated with the \\nterm \\nperiodization. In its most general form, clas-\\nsic periodization divides a long-term training period \\ncalled the \\nmacrocycle (which typically involves six \\nmonths to one year but may be up to four years, \\nsuch as with Olympic athletes) into smaller phases \\ncalled \\nmesocycles (usually lasting several weeks \\nto months), which are also subdivided into weekly \\nmicrocycles. The strength training progresses over \\nthe macrocycle from low resistance (intensity) \\nto high intensity with total volume following the \\nopposite progression, from high to low. A sche -\\nmatic overview of the classic strength and power \\nperiodization scheme can be seen in figure 3.1 \\nand table 3.1.'),\n",

The first phase, or mesocycle, is classified \\nas the hypertrophy phase and is categorized as \\nbeing low intensity. Reps are around 8 to 12 and \\nsometimes as high as 20. It is considered very \\nhigh in volume because sets are usually in the \\nrange of 4 to 5 for each exercise. The goal of \\nthis phase is typically to prepare the athlete for \\nthe high-intensity training that is to follow. The \\nmuscle hypertrophy experienced in this phase \\nwill enhance the gains in strength and power an \\nathlete will make in the later stages. Although \\nthis is termed the hypertrophy phase, it should \\nnot be confused with a periodized program a \\nbodybuilder would use. Hypertrophy is the main \\ngoal in a bodybuilding program, not something an \\nathlete may do only for several months. In some \\nperiodized programs designed for athletes, the \\nhypertrophy phase may be preceded by what is \\nknown as a general preparedness (GP) phase. This \\nis especially true if the person being trained is a \\nrank beginner or an athlete who is returning after \\nan off-season where little, if any, training took \\nplace. This would provide a means of preparing \\nan athlete for the hypertrophy phase with very low \\nintensity and moderate- to high-volume training.\\nThe next mesocycle is usually the strength \\nphase. As the name implies, the major goal during \\nthis phase is to maximize muscle strength. This \\nphase is typically moderate to high in intensity \\nwith reps in the range of two to six and the goal \\nto build up muscle strength. It’s somewhat high \\nin volume, with three or four sets performed per \\nexercise and fewer total exercises performed per \\nmuscle group than during the hypertrophy phase. \\nFollowing the strength phase is the power phase. \\nIt is similar to the strength phase in that the inten-\\nsity is high (reps are in the range of two to three). \\nThe volume is a bit lower; sets usually are about \\nthree per exercise. The point of this phase is to \\nstart transferring the strength gains made during \\nthe first two phases into more explosive power \\nthat serves well for competition.\\nThe final two mesocycles prepare the athlete \\nfor competition. The peaking phase follows the \\npower phase. It is categorized by low volume (only \\none to three sets per exercise are formed) and \\nvery high intensity (reps as low as one per set). \\nThis phase gets the athlete ready for competition \\nVolume\\nIntensity\\nSkill training\\nMajor competitions\\nHypertrophy Strength/\\npower\\nPeaking Active rest\\nFIGURE 3.1 Classic strength and power periodization scheme.\\nAdapted, by permission, from S.J.

After this \\nphase, the athlete drops the strength training \\nand undergoes a period of active rest just before \\ncompetition. The active rest phase is categorized \\nby activity other than strength training such as \\nswimming, hiking, or sport activities like basketball \\nand tennis. This phase usually lasts for only about \\none to two weeks before a competition to allow \\nthe body to recover from all the strenuous training \\nso that it can perform at its best. After competi -\\ntion, this phase may actually continue for several \\nweeks before the periodized training scheme starts \\nagain. For this reason, the active rest phase is \\noften referred to as the \\ntransition phase. Most \\nstrength experts using the classic strength and \\npower periodization program will continue the \\nmesocycle phases for anywhere from three weeks \\nto three months. However, a compressed version \\nof this program would involve changing the phases \\n(hence the intensity and volume) every week. Then \\nthe cycle repeats itself.\\nAlthough classic strength periodization \\nschemes can allow for adaptations in strength \\ntraining, some issues need to be considered with \\nthese models. The first consideration is the fact \\nthat the higher-volume training phase may lead \\nto fatigue if followed consecutively for too long. \\nThis could be a problem for athletes who must \\ncompete at various times throughout the year. The \\nsecond consideration is the fact that the muscle \\nhypertrophy gained during the hypertrophy phase \\nmay not be maintained very well during the later \\nstages, where volume gets considerably low. This \\ncould be a problem for bodybuilders and other \\nathletes who are concerned about muscle mass. \\nTherefore, other periodized schemes have been \\ndeveloped and tested in the gym as well as in \\nthe lab.\\nREVERSE LINEAR PERIODIZATION\\nReverse linear periodization takes the classic \\nstrength and power periodization scheme and \\nruns it backward. Whereas the goal of the classic \\nperiodization model is to maximize an athlete’s \\nstrength and power, the goal of the reverse linear \\nmodel is to maximize muscle hypertrophy or \\nendurance strength, depending on the rep range \\nthat the program concludes with (8 to 12 for \\nhypertrophy and 20 to 30 for endurance strength). \\nResearch supports the concept that the reverse \\nlinear periodization scheme is more effective for \\nincreasing endurance strength than the classic \\nmodel (Rhea et al. 2003).\\nIn essence, the reverse linear model starts with \\nthe power phase, where intensity is very high (two \\nor three reps per set) and volume is low (three \\nsets per exercise). The peaking phase is usually \\nskipped because the athlete is not preparing for \\na competition in which power and strength matter. \\nAfter the athlete follows the power phase for sev-\\neral weeks, the strength phase starts. Again, the \\nstrength phase uses moderate to high intensity \\n(two to six reps per set) and slightly higher volume \\nthan the power phase (three or four sets per exer-\\ncise). The goal of these first two phases is to build \\nthe strength and power to optimize gains in mass \\nor endurance strength.\\nBeing able to lift heavier weight for the desired \\nnumber of reps during the hypertrophy phase can \\nresult in significant gains in muscle mass as well \\nas muscle endurance. The hypertrophy stage \\ncomes last in the program and involves lower \\nintensity (8 to 12 reps per set) and high volume, \\nwhich is the best prescription for building muscle \\nmass. This stage is a good systematic approach \\nto gaining muscle mass, which makes it a smart \\nperiodized plan for bodybuilders. See figure 3.2 \\nfor a sample reverse linear periodization scheme \\nfor muscle hypertrophy.\\nTo make the reverse linear model a better fit for \\noptimizing endurance strength, the power phase \\ncan be eliminated. That means it would start with \\nthe strength phase, then move to the hypertrophy \\nphase, then move to an endurance phase (where \\nthe reps are in the range of 20 to 30), and finally \\nmove to an active rest phase if the athlete is \\ntraining for a competition. A diagram of this model \\nis shown in figure 3.3. As with any periodization \\nscheme, the acute variables can be manipulated \\nwithin each stage to improve the result of the \\nprogram. For instance, a reverse linear model can \\nstart with reps in the 8 to 10 range, then progress \\nto the range of 12 to 15, and end in the range of \\n20 to 30.\\nUNDULATING PERIODIZATION\\nAs the name implies, undulating periodization fol-\\nlows a less linear scheme than does the classic \\nstrength (power) scheme or the reverse linear peri-\\nodization scheme.

This \\nway, instead of sticking with one training phase for \\nseveral weeks or more, the lifter can change inten-\\nsity and volume from one workout to another. For \\nexample, if the lifter were following a whole-body \\ntraining split, he or she might perform the strength \\nworkout on Monday, the endurance strength work-\\nout on Wednesday, and the hypertrophy workout \\non Friday.

For instance, if a person felt tired or \\nsick (or conversely, the person felt exceptionally \\nmotivated and strong one day), the workout could \\nbe changed for that day to better suit mood and \\nphysical health. Or if scheduling was a problem \\nand the lifter was short on time one day, he or \\nshe could switch to a workout with lower volume. \\nAlthough it seems that such a training system \\nthat requires little planning would be less effec -\\ntive than a program that is scheduled months \\nin advance, research has found that undulating \\nperiodized programs are just as effective as \\nlinear periodized models for the development of \\nstrength, power, and muscle mass (Marx et al. \\n2001; Kraemer et al. 2000) and are more effec-\\ntive than nonperiodized programs. One study by \\nRhea, Ball, Phillips, and Burkett (2002) found \\nthat undulating periodized training was more \\neffective for developing strength compared to a \\nlinear periodized plan.\\nIn actuality, the sporadic nature of the undu -\\nlating program works as a default for building \\nmuscle, strength, and power. That’s because peri-\\nodization is based on the fact that a physiological \\nsystem makes adaptations to a stress that it is \\nexposed to. Yet if the system is exposed to the \\nstress for too long, the adaptations will plateau \\nand even reverse to some degree. Given that, \\nthe undulating periodized scheme allows the \\nstress (strength training) to be encountered for \\nvery short periods before it is changed and then \\ncycled back in. In this model, the different types \\nof strength training (heavy, light, fast, or what -\\never) are cycled repeatedly from day to day. So \\nit helps to keep the muscle from getting used to \\nthe stimulus, yet it exposes it frequently enough \\nto cause progressive adaptations.\\nMICROCYCLES\\nWith the classic linear periodization model and \\nthe reverse linear periodization model, sticking \\nwith the same rep range for a full mesocycle, \\nwhich can last many weeks, can have some \\ndrawbacks. Some athletes get bored using the \\nsame rep ranges for several weeks. Another \\nissue discussed earlier is the fact that some of \\nthe adaptations made in a previous mesocycle \\nmay be lost in a later mesocycle. For example, \\ngains in muscle size made during the hypertrophy \\nphase may be lost during the strength and power \\nphases where repetitions performed each set \\nrarely exceed 6.\\nUndulating periodization is one way to remedy \\nthe issues of the mesocycles. However, using \\na linear model, whether it is the classic linear \\nscheme or the reverse linear scheme, has merit. \\nMicrocycles may be an even more effective way of \\nusing linearly periodized training schemes.\\nThe term microcycle refers to weekly changes \\nin the weight used and reps performed. For exam-\\nple, if following the classic linear model, week 1 \\nmight be a muscle endurance microcycle with \\nreps of 12 to 15. Week 2 might be the hyper -\\ntrophy microcycle with reps of 8 to 12. Week 3 \\ncontinues increasing the weight and decreasing \\nthe reps for the strength microcycle with reps \\nof 4 to 6. Then in week 4, which could be the \\npower microcycle, reps drop again to just 2 or \\n3 per set. After week 4, the cycle repeats itself \\nwith week 5 returning to the muscle endurance \\nmicrocycle. These microcycles can keep repeating \\nin this order until the athlete is ready for com -\\npetition, or for a noncompetitive strength trainer, \\nthe program is over after 12 weeks or so. See \\ntable 3.3 for a sample linear scheme that uses \\nmicrocycles. This is very similar to the Shortcut to \\nSize (Micromuscle) program that has gained great \\npopularity online due to the extraordinary gains in \\nmuscle size and strength that are possible with \\nthis 12-week program. For more details on this \\nprogram, see chapter 7.\\nTABLE 3.3 Microcycle Scheme*\\nWeek/Microcycle Weight Rep range\\n1: Muscle Endurance Light 12-15\\n2: Hypertrophy Moderate 8-12\\n3: Strength Moderate-\\nheavy\\n4-6\\n4: Power Heavy 2-3\\n* This table shows the weight and rep range changes that occur \\neach week/microcycle when using a linear scheme with microcycles.'),\n",

A great way to \\nincrease muscle size and strength is to use pro -\\ngrams that combine periodization models.\\nA good example of this is pendulum training. \\nIn pendulum training, you start off using a classic \\nlinear periodization model usually with microcycles. \\nTherefore, you might start with reps in the range of \\n8 to 12 in week 1. Then in week 2, reps drop to 6 to \\n8. In week 3, reps drop again to 3 to 5. In week 4, \\nthe order switches to a reverse linear periodization \\nmodel with reps going back up to the 6-to-8 range \\nand then in week 5 to the 8-to-12 range. Then \\nin week 6 it is back to a linear progression with \\nreps dropping to 6 to 8 reps. The program would \\ncontinue swinging back and forth like this similar \\nto a pendulum—hence the name. See table 3.4 \\nfor a sample pendulum scheme.\\nAnother way to combine periodization models \\nis to use both linear and reverse linear models \\nsimultaneously. This works well with a program \\nthat trains each muscle group twice per week. For \\nexample, with a program that uses a two-day split \\nwith chest, back, and shoulders trained in workouts \\n1 and 3 and legs and arms trained in workouts 2 \\nand 4, workouts 1 and 2 could follow a linear order \\nusing a microcycle system of increasing weight and \\ndecreasing reps with each week. Weeks 3 and 4 \\ncould follow a reverse linear order using a micro -\\ncycle system in which the weight decreases and \\nthe reps increase each week. See table 3.5 for an \\nexample of this scheme. What’s interesting when \\nyou consider the order of the rep ranges with two \\nseparate rep ranges being used each week is that \\nthe scheme is similar to an undulating periodiza-\\ntion model. Here workouts 1 and 2 progress from \\n9 to 11 reps in week 1, to 6 to 8 reps in week 2, \\nand to 3 to 5 reps in week 3. Workouts 3 and 4 \\nstart at 12 to 15 reps in week 1, then jump to 16 \\nto 20 reps in week 2, and finally go to 21 to 30 \\nreps in week 3.

Rarely will you hear the term used \\nin the gym by bodybuilders or powerlifters. These \\nathletes refer to the concept of periodization as \\ncycling. It may sound cooler, but cycling is just a \\nsimpler term for periodization. Although the minor \\ndetails of cycling for powerlifters and bodybuilders \\nare slightly different from the three periodized \\nschemes discussed previously, they rely on the \\nsame premise: Change is good.\\nPowerlifters use several types of cycles to \\nprepare for a competition. A multitude of these \\nare presented in chapters 9 and 10. The most \\ncommon cycle uses a gradual increase in the \\namount of weight used over time. Usually this \\nstarts out as low as 50 percent of the lifter’s 1RM \\nand progresses up to 100 percent of the 1RM \\nweight for that lift over a 6- to 12-week period. See \\ntable 3.6 for a sample 11-week powerlifting cycle.\\nBodybuilders also use numerous cycling strat -\\negies. In fact, an unlimited number of bodybuild -\\ning cycles could be used. These are covered in \\nchapters 6 and 7. The most common ones used \\nare similar to the reverse linear periodization \\nscheme (table 3.7) and the undulating periodiza-\\ntion scheme (table 3.8). Although these athletes \\nmix up their training frequently, the focus tends to \\nstay on reps in the moderate to high range (8 to \\n20). Occasionally, these athletes train with heavy \\nweight and low reps, but these phases are short \\nand infrequent.\\nTABLE 3.7 Linear Muscle\\nWeeks Reps\\nSets (per \\nexercise)\\nRest \\nbetween sets\\n1-2 6-8 3 3-4 min\\n3-4 8-10 3 2-3 min\\n5-6 10-12 3 1-2 min\\n7-8 12-15 3 <1 min\\nTABLE 3.8 Undulating Muscle\\nWEEK 1\\nDay and muscle \\ngroups Reps\\nSets \\n(per \\nexercise)\\nRest \\nbetween \\nsets\\nMonday (chest, \\nshoulders, triceps)\\n8-10 3 2-3 min\\nTuesday (back, biceps) 12-15 3 <1 min\\nWednesday (legs) 6-8 3 3-4 min\\nThursday (chest, \\nshoulders, triceps)\\n12-15 3 <1 min\\nFriday (back, biceps) 6-8 3 3-4 min\\nSaturday (legs) 10-12 3 1-2 min\\nWEEK 2\\nDay and muscle \\ngroups Reps\\nSets \\n(per \\nexercise)\\nRest \\nbetween \\nsets\\nMonday (chest, \\nshoulders, triceps)\\n6-8 3 3-4 min\\nTuesday (back, biceps) 10-12 3 1-2 min\\nWednesday (legs) 8-10 3 3 min\\nThursday (chest, \\nshoulders, triceps)\\n10-12 3 1-2 min\\nFriday (back, biceps) 8-10 3 3 min\\nSaturday (legs) 12-15 3 <1 min\\nTABLE 3.6 Strong Cycle\\nWeek % 1RM Reps Sets\\n1 55% 5 5\\n2 60% 5 5\\n3 65% 5 5\\n4 70% 5 5\\n5 75% 5 5\\n6 85% 3 3\\n7 90% 3 3\\n8 95% 3 3\\n9 95% 2 2\\n10 100%* 2 2\\n11** – – –\\n*Based on previous max.\\n**Active rest.'),\n",

In addition, some novel \\npieces of strength training equipment do not fit \\ninto the standard categories, such as vibration. \\nThis chapter covers the more common forms of \\nstrength training equipment as well as some that \\nare not so common.\\nSIMPLE RESISTANCE\\nThe first category of strength training equipment \\nprovides constant resistance throughout the \\nentire range of motion. This is the simplest form \\nof resistance and is composed of little more than \\nobjects that provide weight. The mass of the \\nobject, whether it be a dumbbell or a weight stack, \\nprovides resistance through gravity. Any time you \\nattempt to pick up a free object, you are fighting \\nthe force of gravity, which pulls the object to the \\nground. The type of contraction that the muscle \\ngoes through when lifting a free object is termed \\nisotonic. It literally means same tone or tension, \\nbecause the weight stays the same while you lift \\nit. If the object is too heavy to move, the type of \\ncontraction the muscle goes through is isometric. \\nBecause the mass of any object can be used in \\nthis manner, this category of strength training \\nequipment is the largest and is composed of the \\nwidest range of equipment.\\nFree Weights\\nThe term free weights refers to equipment moved \\nin the performance of an exercise, which is simply \\nraised and lowered as a complete unit. It is called \\nfree weight because the weight is free to move in \\nany direction and in any manner. Technically, any \\nobject can be considered free weight; however, the \\nterm usually refers to the weight plates and barbell \\nor dumbbell systems and related items found in \\nhome and commercial gyms.\\nbarbell—The bar that weight plates are loaded \\nonto for purposes of strength training. Barbells \\nnormally measure between five and seven feet \\nin length, depending on the type of barbell. There \\nare several different types of barbells:\\nOlympic barbell—A special type of barbell used in \\nOlympic weightlifting and in powerlifting competi-\\ntions as well as in gyms (see figure 4.1). These \\nbars weigh 20 kilograms (just under 45 pounds) \\nand are seven feet in length. The ends of the \\nbar are two inches (five centimeters) in diame-\\nter to fit Olympic weight plates, and the handle \\nsection where you grab the bar is one inch (two \\nand a half centimeters) in diameter. Parts of the \\nhandle section are knurled for better gripping. \\nSome gyms have shorter versions of these bars.\\nFIGURE 4.1 Standard bar and plates (left) contrasted with \\nOlympic bar and plates (right).'),\n",

However, \\nthese barbells have ends that are one inch in \\ndiameter to fit standard weight plates.\\nfixed barbell— A barbell with a predetermined \\nweight (see figure 4.2).\\nFIGURE 4.2 Fixed barbells on a rack.\\nEZ curl bar— A special type of barbell that is \\nbent at several points so that it looks like a \\nstretched-out W (see figure 4.3). This allows \\nthe user to have a grip that is somewhere \\nbetween a fully supinated grip (underhand grip) \\nand a neutral grip. The purpose of this is to \\ntake stress off the wrists as well as place more \\nstress on the long head of the biceps (outer \\nbiceps). An EZ curl bar is occasionally called \\na cambered curling bar.\\nFIGURE 4.3 Curls with an EZ curl bar.\\nfat bar—A special barbell or dumbbell that is larger \\nin diameter on the gripping portion of the bar \\nthan the conventional bars that are one inch in \\ndiameter. Fat bars usually come in two-inch and \\nsometimes three-inch (five- or eight-centimeter) \\ndiameters. Training with fat bars allows users to \\ndevelop greater grip strength than they would by \\nusing a standard one-inch bar. However, research \\nhas shown that using fat bars on pulling exer -\\ncises, such as deadlifts, rows and curls can limit \\nthe weight used on those exercises, which could \\ninterfere with strength and muscle hypertrophy \\ngains of the target muscle.\\nsafety squat bar—A bar that resembles a barbell \\nwith two short padded bars (about 12 inches, \\nor 30 centimeters) that run perpendicular to the \\nbar from the middle. These padded bars rest on \\nthe shoulders and allow the user to grab them \\nas a handle while squatting (see figure 4.4).\\nFIGURE 4.4 Squatting with a safety squat bar.\\ntrap bar—A weight bar with a diamond-shaped or \\nhexagon section in the middle. During the exer-\\ncise, the lifter stands inside the diamond and \\ngrips the transverse handholds on either side \\nof the diamond. This type of bar is sometimes \\ncalled a hex bar, due to its shape, and is typically \\nused for shrugs and deadlifts (see figure 4.5).\\nFIGURE 4.5 Trap bar.'),\n",

There are generally two types of weight \\nplates, but regardless of the type of weight plate, \\nthese are commonly available in weights of 1.25, \\n2.5, 5, 10, 25, 35, 45, and even 100 pounds:\\nOlympic weight plates—These plates have center \\nholes that are 2-1/8 inches (about 5.4 centi -\\nmeters) in diameter to fit on Olympic barbells.\\nstandard weight plates— These plates have \\ncenter holes that are about 1-1/8 inches (about \\n3 centimeters) in diameter to fit on a 1-inch \\nstandard bar.\\nbumper plates— An Olympic weight plate with \\na rubber outer rim and/or coating to reduce \\ndamage to the floor and the weight plate in \\nthe event that it is dropped. These are most \\ncommonly used in Olympic weightlifting where \\nvery heavy weights are lifted overhead and \\nthen dropped.\\ncollar—The clamp used to hold plates securely \\nin place on a barbell or adjustable dumbbell. \\nThe collars used in powerlifting and Olympic \\nweightlifting weigh 5.5 pounds (2.5 kilograms).\\ndumbbell—A short-handled barbell intended pri-\\nmarily for use with one hand. It is usually about \\n8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 centimeters) in total \\nlength; the knurled gripping portion is about 6 \\ninches (15 centimeters) on most dumbbells. \\nSome dumbbells are solid steel with round or \\nhexagon ends, while others use weight plates \\nand can be adjusted to different weights.\\nSpecialty Free-Weight Objects\\nSome free-weight objects don’t fall under the typi-\\ncal category of dumbbell or barbell. These unique \\nobjects provide weight for many conventional and \\nunconventional exercises.\\nmedicine ball—A weighted leather or rubber ball \\nthat varies in size from that of a volleyball to \\na basketball, depending on the weight (2 to \\n30 pounds, or 0.9 to 14 kilograms). Medicine \\nballs can be used for throwing exercises or \\nto simulate most typical exercises done with \\nbarbells or dumbbells (see figure 4.6).\\nkettlebell—This cast-iron free weight resembles a \\ncannonball with a solid handle welded to it. Ket-\\ntlebells come in weights as low as 15 pounds to \\nas high as 50 (about 7 to 23 kilograms), usually \\nin 5- or 10-pound increments. They can be used \\nfor a variety of exercises but are mainly used \\nfor performing swings, snatches, and cleans.\\nhead harness—A leather or nylon head strap that \\nhas a chain attached from one side to the other. \\nWeight plates are added to the chain and the \\ndevice is worn on the head to provide resistance \\nfor neck-strengthening exercises (see figure 4.7).\\nFIGURE 4.7 Neck extensions with a head harness.\\nweighted belt— This equipment resembles a \\nshort weight belt that fits around the small of \\nthe back along with a long chain that runs from \\none side of the belt to the other. Weight plates \\nare added to the chain and supported around \\nthe waist for adding resistance during body-\\nweight exercises such as dips and pull-ups.\\nweight vest—This device is simply a nylon vest \\nwith pockets that hold 1- to 2-pound weights. \\nTotal weight usually adjusts between 2 and 40 \\npounds (0.9 to 18 kilograms), although a few \\nFIGURE 4.6 Throwing a medicine ball.'),\n",

This creates a weighted \\ndevice that changes the distribution of the \\nweight depending on how you hold it and move it.\\nwrist roller—This device is simply composed of \\na short steel or wooden handle with a three- to \\nfour-foot (91- to 122-centimeter) rope attached \\nto it (see figure 4.8). On the other end of the \\nrope weights are attached. To train the forearm \\nflexors, a lifter would roll the handle with a \\nforward motion to lift the weight from the floor \\nuntil the rope is completely wrapped around \\nthe handle. To train the forearm extensors, the \\nlifter would roll the handle in a reverse motion.\\n FIGURE 4.8 Wrist curls with a wrist roller.\\narm blaster—This aluminum device is used to \\nprevent movement of the upper arms when \\ndoing biceps curls. It has straps that suspend it \\nfrom the shoulders so that it sits firmly against \\nthe waist allowing the backs of the arms to \\npress against the arm blaster while the lifter \\nperforms curls (see figure 4.9).\\nland mine—This device is a weighted plate (many \\nlook like home plate on a baseball diamond) \\nthat holds a sleeve that fits the end of a bar -\\nbell. The sleeve is connected to the base with \\na number of free moving joints that allow the \\nbarbell to be rotated from the free end to work \\nthe core muscles, as well as the lower body and \\nupper body muscles (see figure 4.10).\\nFIGURE 4.10 Using a land mine to perform a dead land mine.\\nFree-Weight Accessories\\nBesides the resistance component of strength \\ntraining with free-weight objects, many exercises \\nrequire the use of various benches and racks to \\nsupport the lifter and the free weight.\\nweight benches—Various benches are used along \\nwith free weights and are specifically designed for \\ncertain barbell exercises. These weight benches \\nhave supports for barbells to allow the lifter to \\neasily rack the barbell at the end of the set. \\nFollowing are some types of benches:\\nbench-press bench— A horizontal bench with \\nvertical barbell supports.\\nincline bench-press bench— A bench that is \\nangled up at about 35 to 45 degrees from the \\nfloor so that when a lifter sits on it the head \\nis higher than the hips. The bench is welded \\nto a steel structure that has vertical barbell \\nsupports and a step platform for a spotter \\nto watch over the lifter performing the incline \\nbench press exercise.\\nFIGURE 4.9 Barbell curls with an arm blaster.'),\n",

There are barbell sup -\\nports for doing decline barbell bench presses.\\nshoulder press bench— A bench that has a \\npadded seat and vertical seat back so that \\nwhen the lifter sits on it the torso is vertical, \\nas it should be when doing the barbell shoulder \\npress exercise. The bench is welded to a steel \\nstructure that has vertical barbell supports that \\nsit behind the lifter’s head so that he or she \\ncan easily grab the bar at the start of the set \\nand can rack it without stressing the shoulder \\njoint at the end of the set.\\npreacher bench—A bench that has a seat and \\na padded armrest that is angled at about 45 \\ndegrees to the floor and set in front of the \\nlifter. In front of the armrest is a barbell sup -\\nport. The lifter sits on the seat with the upper \\narms supported on the armrest and performs \\nbiceps curls.\\nfree-standing benches— Some benches do not \\nhave barbell supports because they are used \\nmainly with dumbbells. These benches consist \\nof just the padded bench and leg supports and \\ninclude the following:\\nflat bench—A fixed horizontal bench that is used \\nfor seated or lying exercises that are performed \\nprone or supine.\\nadjustable-incline bench— A bench that allows \\nthe angle of the surface to be adjusted from \\nhorizontal to vertical with various points in \\nbetween.\\nadjustable-decline bench—A bench that angles \\ndown at varying degrees so that the head is \\nlower than the feet. This is often used for chest \\nand abdominal exercises.\\nlow-back bench— A bench that has a short \\nhorizontal seat and a low vertical back pad \\nto support the back during exercises such as \\noverhead presses and triceps extensions.\\nweight rack— A rack that supports a barbell to \\nallow the lifter to grab it from a variety of posi -\\ntions. The following are some types of weight \\nracks:\\npower rack— The most versatile rack is this \\nsafety apparatus that is made of four vertical \\nsteel beams to create a cage that is usually \\nabout five feet (one and a half meters) long, \\nfive feet wide, and seven feet (two meters) tall. \\nThe vertical beams have holes drilled into them \\nevery one to two inches from top to bottom. The \\nholes allow the barbell hooks to be adjusted \\nto different heights. The holes also fit safety \\nbars that can be used to catch the barbell if \\nthe lifter fails to lift the weight. Power racks are \\ntypically used for squats, shrugs, and presses \\n(see figure 4.11a).\\nsquat rack— A steel structure that has bar -\\nbell-support hooks at different heights so that \\nlifters of various statures can easily unrack \\nthe barbell to perform the squat or other \\nstanding exercises. Some squat racks have \\ntwo horizontal beams that are about three \\nfeet (91 centimeters) high and run parallel \\nto each other off the front of the squat rack. \\nThese beams act as a safety rack so that if \\na lifter fails to complete a squat, he or she \\ncan rack the weight on the safety beam (see \\nfigure 4.11b).\\na  \\n b\\nFIGURE 4.11 (a)  Squatting in a power rack contrasted with \\n(b) squatting in a squat rack.\\nstability objects—A multitude of objects can pro -\\nvide unstable support. Unlike a bench, which has \\na stable foundation to support the lifter’s body \\nweight, stability objects are unstable objects that \\nmake an exercise more difficult to perform. This \\nhelps to develop the strength of the core and \\nstabilizer muscles.\\nexercise ball— Also known as a stability ball. \\nThese inflatable balls come in several sizes \\n(30 to 85 centimeters in diameter). They offer a \\nplatform that rolls and gives when a person sits \\nor lies on it, making seated or lying exercises \\nwith dumbbells or barbells much more difficult'),\n",

These can also \\nbe used with body-weight exercises such as \\ncrunches and push-ups.\\nFIGURE 4.12 Dumbbell presses on an exercise ball.\\nBOSU balance trainer—This object resembles the \\ntop half of a large exercise ball with a solid and \\nstable base. It offers most of the benefits of an \\nexercise ball without the rolling, which makes \\nit ideal for building core strength with standing \\nexercises (see figure 4.13).\\nFIGURE 4.13 BOSU balance trainer.\\nstability disc—Small (about 12 to 14 inches in \\ndiameter and 2 to 3 inches in height) pancake-\\nlike disc made of pliable plastic that a person \\ncan stand on or sit on while doing strength \\nexercises (see figure 4.14).\\nFIGURE 4.14 Stability disc.\\nbalance board— A wooden base that has a \\nrounded bottom to provide wobbling when \\nstood on. These are sometimes used for \\nperforming standing strength exercises (see \\nfigure 4.15).\\nFIGURE 4.15 Balance board.\\nCommon Objects\\nLong before dumbbells and barbells were available, \\nathletes and others needing to enhance their strength \\nand fitness used a variety of common objects that \\nserved as free weight, such as stones and sacks \\nof sand. Today, although balanced barbells and \\ndumbbells are available, some people use common \\nobjects (such as food cans or gallon milk jugs) when \\nthey don’t have access to standard free-weight imple-\\nments or choose to lift awkward and unbalanced \\nobjects (such as stones and beer kegs) to develop \\nmore functional strength. Obviously, any object with \\nmass can be used as a strength training tool—a can \\nof soup, a bucket of water, or a cement cylinder block. \\nRocks, logs, and tires are common implements to \\nbe lifted in strongman competitions. The disadvan-\\ntage to lifting common objects is the awkwardness. \\nWithout a clear handle to grab and without an even \\nbalance of weight, lifting common objects requires \\nmore functional ability than free weights require. But \\nlifting such awkward implements helps to develop \\ncore strength and functional strength.\\nstrongman implements—Strongmen are required \\nto lift a number of awkward objects during com-\\npetition. Most events combine strength and \\nmuscle endurance by requiring the competitors \\nto outdo each other by lifting such objects for \\nthe most repetitions or carrying them the most \\nquickly over a certain distance. Some common \\nstrongmen implements include the following:\\nAtlas stone—Atlas stones are large, heavy balls \\nmade of granite or concrete that strongmen \\nmust lift and carry in competition. Sizes range \\nfrom 14 inches to more than 60 inches (36 \\nto 152 centimeters) in diameter and weights \\nrange from about 140 pounds to well over 300 \\npounds (64 to 136 kilograms). Competitors \\ntypically must lift progressively heavier Atlas \\nstones from the ground and load them onto pro-\\ngressively higher pedestals (up to 60 inches). \\nThe competitor who completes the task in the \\nleast amount of time wins.'),\n",

The modified ones found in \\ncompetitions have handles carved into them for \\neasier gripping when lifting. These can range in \\nweight from about 200 to well over 300 pounds \\n(91 to 136 kilograms). The winner is the compet-\\nitor who lifts the heaviest log from the ground to \\noverhead. Aluminum logs are available that have \\nOlympic barbell ends to allow Olympic weight plates \\nto be added for training with different weights.\\ntractor tires— These can range in weight from \\nabout 500 pounds to more than 900 pounds \\n(227 to 408 kilograms), depending on the size. \\nIn strongman competitions the competitor who \\nflips the tire the fastest over a predetermined \\ndistance is the winner.\\ntraining adjuncts— Some common objects are \\nused for enhancing strength in the gym or on the \\nplaying field. The unique mass characteristics \\nof the object (unbalanced weight or progressive \\nweight) offer benefits that free weights don’t. \\nSuch implements include the following:\\nchains—Steel chains can be attached to an Olym-\\npic bar to provide progressive resistance during \\nbarbell exercises such as the bench press or \\nsquat. The unique thing about chains is that as \\neach link lifts off the ground, the weight being \\nlifted increases, offering linear variable resistance \\nthroughout the range of motion. This type of resis-\\ntance provides greater resistance the further you \\nmove through the range of motion of an exercise.\\nbeer keg—An empty beer keg weighs approxi -\\nmately 30 pounds (14 kilograms). The handles \\non a beer keg make it easy to grip, but the \\nrotund shape makes it awkward to lift and con-\\ntrol. Some strength coaches have their football, \\nbasketball, baseball, and hockey players as well \\nas other athletes lift kegs as a way to develop \\nmore functional strength.\\neveryday objects—Objects that are found in most \\nhomes can be used in place of free weights \\nwhen free weights are unavailable for standard \\nstrength training exercises. Some objects com-\\nmonly used include the following:\\nsoup cans—These can range in weight from 10 \\nounces to a little over 1 pound (.28 to .45 kilo-\\ngram). Similar to dumbbells, soup cans can be \\nheld in the hands for almost any exercise that \\nwould normally be performed with dumbbells. \\nBecause of the limit in weight available, cans \\nare best suited for people with poor strength \\nor for those performing workouts that have very \\nhigh reps.\\ngallon jugs—Plastic gallon jugs weigh about 8 \\npounds (4 kilograms) when filled with fluid or 14 \\npounds (6 kilograms) when filled with sand. The \\nhandles allow them to be gripped in a fashion \\nsimilar to that of dumbbells (although they’re \\nmore awkward to lift). The weight can be adjusted \\nby altering the amount of fluid or sand in the jugs.\\nHuman Body\\nYour own body weight or that of a training partner \\ncan be used as a form of resistance.\\nown body weight— Exercises such as push-\\nups, chin-ups, dips, body-weight squats, and \\ncrunches use pure body weight, nothing else, \\nto get the job done (see figure 4.16).\\nFIGURE 4.16 Dips.\\npartner body weight—When training with a partner, \\nyou can do a variety of exercises that use the \\npartner’s body weight as resistance. For exam-\\nple, rows, bench presses, and squats can all be \\ndone with the weight of a training partner (see \\nfigure 4.17).\\nFIGURE 4.17 Body rows.'),\n",

They can also be used for leg raises for \\nthe abdominals and for a variety of other exer-\\ncises. Some dipping bars are angled inward at \\none end so that the distance between the two \\nbars is different. This allows you to perform \\ndips with varying grip width.\\nvertical bench— This device is composed of a \\nlong, vertical, padded bench that is attached \\nto a metal platform that has handles and arm-\\nrests. The lifter suspends the body by support-\\ning the weight with the forearms and pressing \\nthe back against the pad. This bench is used for \\nleg raises (see figure 4.18) and is sometimes \\nreferred to as a captain’s chair. Some vertical \\nbenches have dip bars extended off the front.\\nFIGURE 4.18 Knee raises on a vertical bench.\\nback extension bench— A high, short, padded \\nbench that has leg pads set at the same height \\nas the bench. This allows the lifter to lie prone \\nwith the pelvis resting on the padded bench \\nand the feet secured under the leg pads while \\ndoing back extensions.\\nSuspension trainer— The TRX is responsible for \\nmaking suspension training popular. But long \\nbefore TRX, chains or ropes with handles were \\nused. Today there are numerous other suspen-\\nsion trainer brands that have followed in the \\nfootsteps of TRX. Suspension training involves \\nstraps, often made of canvas or nylon that sus-\\npend part of the body (usually from the arms or \\nfeet) to allow the person’s own body to provide \\nresistance. For example, you can do inverted \\nrows using a suspension trainer to work the lats \\n(see figure 4.19).\\nFIGURE 4.19 Inverted rows on a TRX.\\nSimple Weight Machines\\nSimple weight machines are those machines and \\napparatuses that provide a constant level of resis-\\ntance throughout the entire range of motion. These \\ndevices include linear guided machines and cable \\npulley machines. They contain a weight that must \\nbe moved. The lifter directly moves the weight along \\nits guide rods or through a cable pulley system.\\nLinear Guided Machines\\nLinear guided machines consist of an apparatus \\nthat rides on two guide rods. This limits the move-\\nment to a linear, or straight, movement. These \\ntypes of machines usually require the addition of \\nweight plates for added resistance.\\nSmith machine—A type of machine that consists \\nof a barbell that rides along two vertical rods \\nthat serve as guides. The bars permit the \\nbarbell to move only in a vertical direction, \\nbut they have safety catches at several points \\nfrom the bottom of the machine to the top to'),\n",

This machine is typically used just \\nfor exercises that require vertical pushing or \\npulling, such as the squat, bench press, and \\nrow (see figure 4.20).\\nFIGURE 4.20 Incline bench press on a Smith machine.\\nleg press—This machine consists of a sled that \\nrides along two rods that are angled at approx-\\nimately 45 degrees. There is a seat for a lifter \\nto sit in while placing the feet on the sled (see \\nfigure 4.21). After the lifter disengages the \\nsafety bar, the sled is free to move up and down \\nthe linear guide rod. However, the natural arc of \\nmotion of the legs in that position is curvilinear \\n(a combination of a curve and a straight line). \\nThis has prompted some manufacturers of \\nweight machines to design leg press machines \\nthat follow a curvilinear path. This more natural \\nmotion places less stress on the knees.\\nFIGURE 4.21 The leg press.\\nhack squat—This machine for leg exercises is \\nsimilar to the leg press except that the lifter \\nstands rather than sits. A padded sled rides \\nalong two guide rods that are angled at about \\n50 to 80 degrees. The lifter stands in the hack \\nsquat with the back against the padded sled \\nand the shoulders under the shoulder pads. \\nAfter disengaging the safety bars, the lifter \\nsquats down and back up, allowing the sled \\nto follow.\\nCable Pulley Machines\\nCable pulley machines refer to exercise machines \\nthat are based on a simple system of cables and \\npulleys. In their most basic form they consist of a \\ncable that routes through a pulley (or several pul-\\nleys) and connects to a weight stack. A pulley is a \\nfreely rotating wheel used to change the direction \\nof force applied by a cable. This allows for force to \\nbe applied to a muscle in a variety of directions, \\nsuch as horizontal. A weight stack is a stack of \\nspecialized weight plates (usually rectangular in \\nshape and weighing 5 to 20 pounds each) that \\nare fixed so that they can slide vertically on the \\nguide rods of a weight machine. Each weight plate \\nis drilled with a horizontal hole that allows a pin \\nto be placed through the plate. This weight and all \\nthose above it may then be lifted by the moveable \\nrod, which is typically attached to a cable or lever \\narm. When tension is placed on the cable (that \\nis, the cable is pulled), the weight stack is lifted \\nalong its guide rods, thereby supplying resistance. \\nSome home machines, such as Bowflex, use flex-\\nible rods for resistance instead of a weight stack. \\nCables offer a number of benefits to weightlifters. \\nBecause the cable can be pulled in a number \\nof directions, it offers constant tension on the \\nmuscle throughout the entire range of motion \\n(see figure 4.22).\\nFIGURE 4.22 The cable crossover.'),\n",

It includes machines that purposely vary the \\nresistance throughout the range of motion and \\nequipment that varies the resistance throughout \\nthe range of motion in an uncontrolled fashion.\\nCam-Based Resistance Machines\\nCam-based resistance machines are the type of \\nweight machines found in most gyms. They are \\noften called selectorized machines because of the \\nweight stack that is on most of these machines. \\nHowever, some cam-based machines are plate \\nloaded. The most popular brands are Cybex, Life \\nFitness, Nautilus, PreCor, Hoist, and Paramount.\\nThe cam is an ellipse connected to the move -\\nment arm of the machine on which the cable \\nor belt travels. The purpose of the cam is to \\nprovide variable resistance, which changes how \\nheavy the weight feels (but the actual weight \\nnever changes) as the lifter moves through the \\nrange of motion of the exercise. The reason \\nthe perception of the weight needs to change \\nis that each joint movement has an associated \\nstrength curve. That is, at different angles of the \\njoint the strength of the agonist muscle varies. \\nFor example, during a biceps curl, the strength \\nof the agonist muscles (mainly the biceps) pro -\\ngressively gets stronger up to about 90 degrees \\nof bend at the elbow. After that, the strength \\nprogressively decreases as the curl continues. \\nThis is known as an ascending and descending \\nstrength curve.\\nThere are three types of strength curves and, \\ntherefore, three basic cam shapes that correspond \\nto each strength curve:\\nascending and descending curve— This type \\nof strength curve was described previously \\nwith the biceps curl as an example. In this \\ntype of curve the strength increases up to \\nabout the halfway point of the movement and \\nthen decreases through the rest of the move-\\nment. For this reason it is often referred to \\nas bell shaped. The shape of the ascending \\nand descending cam is similar to a bell or an \\ninverted U with the largest radius in the middle \\n(see figure 4.30a).\\nascending curve— In the ascending curve the \\nstrength progressively increases through the \\nentire range of motion. An example of this is \\nthe bench press. The farther the weight moves \\naway from the chest, the stronger the agonist \\nmuscles are. The shape of the ascending cam \\nis oblong with the largest radius at the distal \\nend (see figure 4.30b).\\ndescending curve—In the descending curve the \\nstrength progressively decreases through the \\nentire range of motion. This type of strength \\ncurve can be experienced during the row \\nexercise. As the handles are pulled closer to \\nthe body, the strength of the agonist muscles \\ndecreases. The shape of the descending cam \\nis oblong with the largest radius at the proximal \\nend (see figure 4.30c).'),\n",

Therefore, much like \\ncam-based machines, the counterbalanced lever \\narms vary the resistance throughout the range of \\nmotion by altering the amount of weight that coun-\\nterbalances the weight being moved. These are \\nusually plate-loaded machines; however, some of \\nthem use a weight stack system. The most popular \\nline of lever-arm resistance machines is Hammer \\nStrength by Life Fitness (see figure 4.31).\\nFIGURE 4.31 A Hammer Strength chest press.\\nResistance With Pull\\nSome exercise devices don’t rely on mass for resis-\\ntance but on the energy their material supplies. \\nSprings, bands, and other material that resist being \\npulled are such devices. These devices provide \\nonly ascending resistance, because the resistance \\nprogressively increases over the range of motion.\\nSprings\\nThe force generated by a spring is a restoring force, \\nwhich attempts to move the two attachment points \\nback to their original resting positions when they \\nare either pulled farther apart or pushed closer \\ntogether. The force a spring supplies depends \\non its material and the diameter of its coils. The \\ndistance the spring is pulled or compressed also \\nchanges the force, because the farther the ends \\nare moved away from their original position, the \\nmore force they will supply. This is known as the \\nspring rate—the rate at which tension increases \\nas the ends move. This characteristic makes it \\nimpossible to maintain a particular resistance level \\nover the movement of the exercise.\\nAs the spring is deflected, resistance goes up; \\nas it is relaxed, resistance goes down. Because \\nof spring rate, users are forced to select a resis -\\ntance that will be within their strength capability at \\nmaximum deflection, or they won’t be able to do \\nthe exercise movement at all. As a result, during \\nthe first 50 percent or more of the movement, \\nresistance is often too low to produce much bene-\\nfit. Spring-resistance exercise devices come in a \\nvariety of setups. These include simple handheld \\ndevices that were popular in the 1950s, such as \\nthe Bull Worker, Chest Expander, and Grip Master \\n(see figure 4.32). Although strength training has \\nprogressed far beyond spring resistance, some \\nspring devices are still being used in certain \\nproducts such as hand grippers (see figure 4.33), \\nPilates exercise machines, and the Stamina Gyro-\\ntonics spring-resistance exercise machine.\\nc\\na\\n b\\nFIGURE 4.30 Types of cam machines: (a) ascending and descending cam, (b) ascending cam, and (c) descending cam.'),\n",

However, the force is \\napplied only when the ends of the material are \\nbeing pulled away from one another. Like springs, \\nelastic bands and tubing have a spring rate. That \\nis, as they are lengthened, the resistance they \\nprovide increases (see figure 4.34). This type of \\nresistance is known as linear variable resistance \\nand provides numerous benefits that free weights \\ncannot. Because the resistance gets harder as you \\npull the bands, it is great for targeting the fast-\\ntwitch muscle fibers and developing greater muscle \\npower. Because they are lightweight and portable, \\nbands and tubing allow exercisers to work out at \\nhome or while away from home. They can also \\nbe added to free weights to provide both isotonic \\nresistance from the free weights and the linear \\nvariable resistance from the bands. Research \\nshows that this method can produce superior \\ngains in muscle strength and power than using free \\nweights alone. Bands and tubes are color coded \\nto represent a certain resistance level. See table \\n4.1 for color and resistance codes.\\nTABLE 4.1 Tube and Band Resistance\\nBand or tube color Resistance level\\nYellow Extra light\\nGreen Light\\nRed Medium\\nBlue Heavy\\nBlack Extra heavy\\nOrange Extra, extra heavy\\nResistance levels are measured at 100 percent elongation and \\ntwice the unstretched length. They should not be stretched beyond \\nthis point.\\nSPEED MACHINES\\nThis category of strength training equipment deals \\nwith machines that control the rate of speed of \\nmovement. The type of muscle contraction where \\nthe speed remains constant is considered iso -\\nkinetic. Equipment that controls the speed of move-\\nment provides resistance simply by moving through \\na range of motion at a particular set speed while the \\nlifter applies as much force as possible to the lever \\narm without altering the speed at which the lever \\narm moves. Because the lever arm must be moved \\nat a controlled, constant rate, the machines that \\nprovide this type of resistance—known as isokinetic \\ndynamometers—are controlled by a computer.\\nisokinetic dynamometer— This computerized \\nresistance machine can be programmed to \\nmove at a variety of set speeds. These are \\ncommonly found only in laboratory settings or \\nsports medicine clinics as a tool for measuring \\nthe amount of force that an athlete can apply. \\nThis type of equipment is usually interfaced \\nwith a computer to not only control the rate of \\nspeed of the movement but to measure force \\napplied as well. There are several disadvan -\\ntages of isokinetic dynamometers. The first \\nis the fact that the only motion they permit \\nis angular. In other words, they permit only \\nflexion or extension at the elbow, wrist, knee, \\nor ankle. They cannot be used for pressing \\nFIGURE 4.34 Elastic bands.'),\n",

The other disadvantage of \\nisokinetic dynamometers is that no isokinetic \\nmuscle actions actually occur in real-life \\nmovements.\\nNONTRADITIONAL AND NEW \\nAPPARATUS\\nThe last category of strength training equipment \\ncovers equipment that is typically not categorized \\namong the other more common forms of strength \\ntraining equipment. These devices include vibra -\\ntion machines, electronic and computerized resis-\\ntance machines, pneumatic resistance machines, \\nhydraulic resistance machines, and the Bodyblade. \\nCommon to them all is the fact that the way they \\nprovide resistance is novel.\\nVibration Machines\\nWhole-body vibration machines usually consist \\nof a device that the user can stand, lie, sit, or \\nplace the hands or any other part of the body on \\nto transmit vibration to the body tissues the user \\nwishes to stimulate (see figure 4.35). Most of \\nthese vibration machines are about the size of a \\ntypical stair stepper, and the vibration platform is \\nabout 32 inches by 20 inches (81 by 51 centime-\\nters). The control panel allows the user to change \\nthe speed (or frequency) and the magnitude of \\nthe vibration.\\nFIGURE 4.35 Vibration machine.\\nMost machines have vibration plates that move \\nup and down and side to side, while others work \\nas a high-speed wobble board. The energy from the \\nmechanical vibration (of the plate) is transferred \\nthrough the body, causing the muscle fibers to \\ncontract and relax at an extremely rapid rate and \\nwith very high force. Research shows that per -\\nforming vibration training for several weeks can \\nincrease muscle strength and power (Issurin and \\nTenenbaum 1999) as well as increase the release \\nof growth hormone and testosterone, which are \\nanabolic hormones (Bosco et al. 2000). Although \\nmost people cannot understand how vibration can \\nbe considered a method of strength training, it is \\nslowly being recognized for its ability to increase \\nstrength, power, and possibly muscle growth.\\nElectronic and Computerized \\nResistance Machines\\nElectronic and computerized machines provide \\nresistance through gears and belts connected to \\na motor. These are programmed to provide variable \\nresistance throughout the range of motion to follow \\nthe strength curve of the muscle being trained. \\nResistance can be increased in increments as \\nsmall as one pound through a touch screen, \\nbutton, or foot pedal. Some machines can be \\nprogrammed to provide greater resistance during \\nthe eccentric portion of the exercise.\\nPneumatic Resistance Machines\\nPneumatic resistance machines use a compressor \\nto supply air pressure for resistance. This allows \\nthe lifter to adjust the resistance on his or her own \\nthroughout the range of motion (see figure 4.36). \\nThe benefit of this is that as the muscles fatigue \\nduring a set, the resistance can be reduced to \\nallow more reps to be completed.\\nFIGURE 4.36 Pneumatic machine.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\n39Strength Training Equipment\\nBoth electronic and pneumatic machines work \\nin one plane, so the user’s motion is predefined. \\nElectronic and pneumatic machines can be less \\nintimidating and safer for beginning exercisers \\nbecause weight stacks aren’t visible and plates \\ndo not have to be loaded. Some exercisers do not \\nlike electronic or pneumatic equipment, however, \\nbecause they don’t provide the feel of lifting an \\nactual weight stack, dumbbell, or barbell. These \\nmodalities also can be more expensive than other \\nstrength training equipment, and they require \\nspecial wiring for electricity or a layout to accom-\\nmodate an air compressor and hoses.\\nBecause of their uniqueness and ability to \\nsuit any population, electronic and pneumatic \\nmachines can be an excellent investment and pro-\\nvide variety in strength training for all exercisers.\\nHydraulic Resistance Machines\\nHydraulic resistance machines provide resis -\\ntance through hydraulics. The lever arm on these \\nmachines is connected to a hydraulic piston that \\nprovides resistance against the oil-filled chamber \\nit resides in. The problem with hydraulic resistance \\nmachines is that they allow for concentric contrac-\\ntions only. Therefore, most hydraulic machines \\ntrain dual muscles but only through the concentric \\nportion. For instance, the hydraulic biceps machine \\nis a biceps–triceps machine because after the user \\ncurls the weight up, he or she must press it back \\ndown using the triceps muscles.\\nBodyblade\\nBodyblade, shown in figure 4.37, is a five-foot-long \\nfiberglass beam that resembles a snow ski and \\nworks by the laws of inertia (an object set in motion \\nremains in motion until another force acts on it to \\nstop or change its direction). The user holds the \\nmiddle of it and pushes and pulls on the apparatus \\nto start it oscillating. During use, it oscillates at \\nan average rate of about 270 times per minute. \\nThese oscillations in the ends of the blade create \\na force that the holder must resist to literally keep \\nit from flying out of the hands. With each oscillation \\nthe muscles of the arms and core must resist the \\nmovement by contracting. The greater the ampli -\\ntude of the blade ends (the farther they flex up and \\ndown), the more force the user must apply to resist \\nthe movement. By varying the positions of the body \\nor direction of the flexing blade, the user can target \\nspecific muscle groups throughout the body. Since \\nthe blade can be used at any angle and position, \\na major benefit to this piece of equipment is that \\nit can mimic the movements in a particular sport \\nand provide the required specificity of training. The \\ndisadvantage of the Bodyblade is the fact that it \\nis limited mainly to upper-body and core exercises \\nwith little application for the lower-body muscles.\\nFIGURE 4.37 Bodyblade.\\nSUMMARY\\nStrength training equipment has developed over \\nthe decades from simple free weights to complex \\nmachinery that provide resistance through novel \\nmechanisms. This, however, is not to say that the \\nmore modern equipment is better than the sim -\\nplest form of free weights. In fact, free weights \\nhave many advantages and very few disadvan -\\ntages. Modern resistance machines, on the other \\nhand, tend to have many more disadvantages \\nthan free weight equipment. Because all forms of \\nstrength training equipment offer different advan-\\ntages and are limited by different disadvantages, \\nit is best to use a variety of training equipment in \\nyour strength training program.'),\n",

While \\nadvanced training techniques—like those described \\nin chapter 6—can help you rapidly advance muscle \\ngains, you must first understand how to organize a \\nbasic training program. This chapter demonstrates \\nhow to put together a basic yet highly effective pro-\\ngram that you can build on later with more advanced \\ntraining methods as you progress.\\nIf your primary goal is to build muscle mass, \\nthen you must consider several things when struc-\\nturing your strength training program. You will need \\nto consider the variables discussed in chapter 2. \\nThese include the choice of exercises you will per-\\nform, the order of those exercises, how many sets \\nof each exercise you will do, how heavy a weight \\nyou will use on those exercises, how much rest \\nyou will allow between sets, and even how fast or \\nslow your reps are. You will also need to consider \\nhow often you will train each muscle group, how \\nyou will split up your training, and how you will \\nperiodize (or cycle) your training for optimal results.\\nWEEKLY SPLITS\\nMost weightlifters break their training down into \\na weekly period. While this isn’t a necessity, it \\nseems to be the simplest approach to split up \\ntraining days because our calendar revolves \\naround a weekly schedule. All other activities in \\nour lives—school, work, television programs, and \\nleisure activities—all follow a weekly schedule. It’s \\nonly logical to break your strength training down \\ninto a similar period. How you split your training will \\ninfluence how often you train each muscle group \\nper week. Choosing a training split that is the most \\nadvantageous for you depends on several factors, \\nsuch as your training experience, your overall goals, \\nyour schedule, and even convenience.\\nThe following seven training splits are the most \\ncommon and effective for the majority of bodybuild-\\ners. These splits start with the easiest (whole-body \\ntraining) split for beginners (those with less than \\nsix months of consistent strength training) and pro-\\ngressively become more intense as they advance \\nthrough push–pull training splits and two-day train-\\ning splits, which are ideal for intermediate lifters \\n(those with less than one year of consistent strength \\ntraining) and end with five-day training splits and \\ntwice-a-day training splits, which are geared for the \\nadvanced lifter (those with over a year of consis -\\ntent strength training). Choosing the right split will \\ndepend primarily on your training experience, but you \\nshould also take into consideration your schedule.\\nWhole-Body Training\\nWhole-body training refers to single workouts that \\nstress every major muscle group. In other words, \\nthe entire body is trained in every workout. Because \\nyou will need to train up to 11 major muscle groups \\n(chest, shoulders, back, quadriceps, hamstrings, \\nbiceps, triceps, forearms, trapezius, calves, and \\nabdominals) in each workout, the number of \\nexercises and sets you can do per muscle group \\nis minimal. This allows you to train each muscle \\ngroup more frequently because it receives a lim -\\nited amount of stress at each workout. Typically, \\nmost whole-body training workouts use one or two \\nexercises per muscle group, and total sets per \\nmuscle group rarely exceed six. Compare this to the \\nfour-day and five-day training splits, which allow the \\nweightlifter to hit three to six exercises and a total'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength44\\nof 12 to 30 sets per muscle group. The fewer total \\nsets a muscle group receives, the less recuperation \\nit usually needs before being trained again.\\nWhole-body training splits allow you to train each \\nmuscle group about three times per week. This type \\nof training split is best for beginning weightlifters \\n(those with up to six months of training experience), \\nthose who want to train each muscle group more \\nfrequently, and those who are interested in cutting \\ndown on body fat. The reason whole-body training is \\nthe best choice for beginners is that the initial adap-\\ntations made in a strength training program involve \\nthe nervous system. That is, in the first few months \\nof strength training, the primary improvements are \\nseen in the motor units (the nerve fibers that serve \\nthe muscle cells). These improvements allow the \\nmuscles to contract more efficiently and are best \\ntrained by repetition. This means that the best \\nway for beginners to train is with high repetitions \\nand more frequent training to program the nervous \\nsystem. They should use the same exercises in each \\nworkout to maximize the learning effect that will have \\nthe greatest benefit on the nervous system.\\nWhole-body training is effective for building \\nmuscle mass for two reasons. The first benefit \\nis known as the staircase effect. Training each \\nmuscle group every other day (or about three days \\nper week) allows you to build onto the effects of \\nthe previous workout. If you wait too long between \\nworkouts, you’re back to square one—almost as if \\nyou are starting over from the original point. Some \\nexperts believe that the staircase effect is critical \\nto muscle adaptation. The second benefit to whole-\\nbody training is that it stimulates a large portion \\nof the body’s muscle mass. This leads to higher \\nproduction of growth hormone and testosterone \\n(important for stimulating muscle growth) than \\nworkouts that train fewer muscle groups. If you are \\nan advanced weightlifter, the best way to use whole-\\nbody training is to mix up the exercises at every \\nworkout. This allows you to hit each muscle group \\nfrom a variety of angles for better stimulation of the \\nmajority of muscle fibers within each muscle group.\\nWhen it comes to shedding body fat, no workout \\nsplit is more conducive to that goal than whole-\\nbody training. Training all the major muscle groups \\nrevs up cellular processes in all the muscle cells, \\nwhich increases the metabolic rate for up to 48 \\nhours after the workout is over. This means you \\nwill burn more calories while sitting around doing \\nnothing.

This \\nallows you to train each muscle group two or \\nthree times per week depending on whether your \\nschedule allows for four or six days of training \\neach week. The four-day-per-week schedule is a \\ngood advancement for the beginner who is pro -\\ngressing from whole-body training. The advantage \\nof upper- and lower-body training over whole-body \\ntraining is that you can do more volume for each \\nmuscle group with upper- and lower-body training. \\nBecause you train fewer muscle groups each \\nworkout, you have the time to do more exer -\\ncises and total sets for each muscle group. This \\nmeans you can train each muscle group more \\nintensely than with whole-body training. However, \\nthis means the muscles will require more rest \\non an upper- and lower-body training split. For \\nthis reason most bodybuilders using this split \\ntrain four days per week, as shown in table 5.3. \\nThis allows for two or three days of rest for each \\nmuscle group between workouts and allows for \\ndifferent exercises to be done for each muscle \\ngroup on the separate workouts.\\nUPPER BODY (THURSDAY) \\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nChest Dumbbell bench press 3 8-10\\nIncline dumbbell fly 3 8-10\\nBack Barbell row 3 6-8\\nReverse-grip pulldown 3 8-10\\nShoulders Barbell shoulder press 3 6-8\\nUpright row 3 10-12\\nTrapezius Dumbbell shrug 3 8-10\\nBiceps Incline dumbbell curl 3 8-10\\nCable curl 2 10-12\\nTriceps Lying triceps extension 3 8-10\\nTriceps dip 2 8-10\\nLOWER BODY (FRIDAY) \\nQuadriceps Squat 3 6-8\\nDumbbell lunge 3 10-12\\nHamstrings Romanian deadlift 3 8-10\\nCalves Seated calf raise 3 15-20\\nStanding calf raise 3 15-20\\nAbdominals Cable crunch 3 10-12\\nReverse crunch 3 15-20\\nTABLE 5.3 Upper- and Lower-Body Training Split\\nUPPER BODY (MONDAY)\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nChest Incline bench press 3 6-8\\nDumbbell fly 3 8-10\\nBack Pull-up 3 6-8\\nDumbbell row 3 8-10\\nShoulders Dumbbell shoulder \\npress\\n3 6-8\\nLateral raise 3 10-12\\nTrapezius Smith machine shrug 3 6-10\\nBiceps Barbell curl 3 8-10\\nPreacher curl 2 10-12\\nTriceps Close-grip bench press 3 8-10\\nTriceps pressdown 2 10-12\\nLOWER BODY (TUESDAY) \\nQuadriceps Leg press 3 6-8\\nLeg extension 3 10-12\\nHamstrings Seated leg curl 3 10-12\\nCalves Leg press calf raise 3 15-20\\nSeated calf raise 3 15-20\\nAbdominals Hanging leg raise 3 10-12\\nCrunch 3 15-20'),\n",

The benefits of the two-day \\ntraining split are the same as for the upper- and \\nlower-body training split. However, the advantage \\nto the two-day training split is that it better bal -\\nances the number of muscle groups trained for \\neach workout. You can use the two-day training \\nsplit to train each muscle group either twice a \\nweek or three times per week, depending on your \\nschedule and the amount of time you want to \\nallow muscle groups to recover.\\nTABLE 5.4 Two-Day Training Split\\nMONDAY\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nChest Decline bench press 3 6-8\\nIncline cable fly 3 8-10\\nBack Close-grip pulldown 3 8-10\\nSmith machine row 3 8-10\\nShoulders Smith machine \\nshoulder press\\n3 6-8\\nCable lateral raise 3 10-12\\nTrapezius Barbell shrug 3 6-8\\nAbdominals Hanging leg raise 3 10-12\\nOblique crunch 3 15-20\\nTUESDAY\\nQuadriceps Smith machine squat 3 6-10\\nOne-leg leg extension 3 12-15\\nHamstrings Dumbbell Romanian \\ndeadlift\\n3 8-10\\nCalves Donkey calf raise 3 15-20\\nSeated calf raise 3 15-20\\nBiceps Barbell curl 3 8-10\\nCable concentration \\ncurl\\n2 10-12\\nTriceps Seated triceps \\nextension\\n3 8-10\\nTriceps pressdown 2 10-12\\nTHURSDAY\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nChest Incline dumbbell press 3 8-10\\nMachine fly 3 10-12\\nBack Seated cable row 3 8-10\\nWide-grip pulldown 3 8-10\\nShoulders Dumbbell shoulder \\npress\\n3 8-10\\nBarbell front raise 3 10-12\\nTrapezius Behind-the-back barbell \\nshrug\\n3 8-10\\nAbdominals Hip thrust 3 15-20\\nExercise-ball crunch 3 15-20\\nFRIDAY\\nQuadriceps Leg press 3 6-8\\nDumbbell lunge 3 10-12\\nHamstrings Lying leg curl 3 10-12\\nCalves Seated calf raise 3 15-20\\nLeg press calf raise 3 15-20\\nBiceps Alternating dumbbell \\ncurl\\n3 8-10\\nPreacher curl 2 10-12\\nTriceps Triceps dip 3 6-10\\nLying triceps extension 2 8-10'),\n",

Dividing the \\nbody into three separate workouts allows you to \\nfurther increase the volume that is typically used in \\nwhole-body training, upper- and lower-body training, \\nand two-day training splits. This type of split allows \\nyou to give each muscle group three to seven days \\nof rest between workouts. Most bodybuilders using \\nthis system train each muscle group either once \\nor twice per week. When training muscle groups \\njust once per week, the typical three-day training \\nsplit is done on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, as \\nshown in table 5.5. Although the training doesn’t \\nhave to take place on these precise three days, it is \\nbest to provide one day of rest between workouts. \\nHowever, if your schedule does not allow for this, \\nit is perfectly fine to train two or even all three of \\nthe workouts on consecutive days. This three-day \\ntraining split is convenient for bodybuilders who \\ntrain with high intensity or high volume because of \\nthe amount of rest allowed. For those interested \\nin training each muscle group twice per week, the \\nthree-day training split can be done on Monday, \\nTuesday, and Wednesday and then repeated Thurs-\\nday, Friday, and Saturday with a rest day on Sunday. \\nLower volume should be used for most muscle \\ngroups when training this frequently.\\nTABLE 5.5 Three-Day Training Split\\nMONDAY\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nChest Bench press 3 8-10\\nIncline dumbbell press 3 8-10\\nCable crossover 3 10-12\\nShoulders Dumbbell shoulder \\npress\\n3 8-10\\nUpright row 3 8-10\\nBent-over lateral raise 3 10-12\\nTrapezius Dumbbell shrug 3 6-8\\nTriceps Seated triceps \\nextension\\n3 8-10\\nTriceps pressdown \\n(rope)\\n3 10-12\\nAbdominals Hanging leg raise 3 10-12\\nWEDNESDAY\\nQuadriceps Squat 3 8-10\\nLeg press 3 6-8\\nLeg extension 3 10-12\\nHamstrings Lying leg curl 3 10-12\\nCalves Standing calf raise 3 10-12\\nSeated calf raise 3 12-15\\nFRIDAY\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nBack Pull-up 3 6-10\\nBarbell row 3 6-8\\nSeated cable row (wide \\ngrip)\\n3 8-10\\nStraight-arm pressdown 3 10-12\\nBiceps Barbell curl 3 8-10\\nPreacher curl 3 8-10\\nForearms Wrist curl 3 10-12\\nAbdominals Standing cable crunch 3 10-12\\nReverse crunch 3 12-15'),\n",

This allows you to train fewer muscle groups \\neach workout. By training fewer muscle groups per \\nworkout, you can increase the volume and intensity \\nof your workouts. Both of these factors are important \\nfor continued progress as your training experience \\ngrows. Most four-day training splits are done on a \\nMonday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday schedule, \\nand rest days are taken on Wednesday, Saturday, \\nand Sunday. A common way to break up the body’s \\nmuscle groups is by training chest, triceps, and \\nabdominals on Mondays; quadriceps, hamstrings, \\nand calves on Tuesdays; shoulders, trapezius, and \\nabdominals on Thursdays; and back, biceps, and \\nforearms on Friday, as covered in table 5.6.\\nThe four-day training split pairs larger muscle \\ngroups with smaller ones that assist the larger \\nmuscle groups, such as chest with triceps. The \\ntriceps assist the chest muscles (pectorals) in \\nall pressing exercises such as the bench press. \\nThe logic behind this technique is that the chest \\nworkout also works the triceps muscles. With \\nthis in mind, it makes sense to continue with \\nexercises that further target the triceps. This is \\nthe same with pairing back, biceps, and forearms \\nas well as quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves. \\nAlong this line of reasoning, you could also pair \\nchest with shoulders and trapezius because \\nthe shoulder (deltoid) muscles assist the chest \\nduring all exercises that target the chest. The \\nmost important rule here is that larger muscle \\ngroups are trained before the smaller muscle \\ngroups that assist them, because if you train the \\nsmaller muscle groups first, they will be fatigued \\nwhen you are training the larger muscle group and \\nwill limit strength on the exercises for the larger \\nmuscle group.\\nTHURSDAY\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nShoulders Barbell shoulder press 3 8-10\\nLateral raise 3 10-12\\nFront raise 2 10-12\\nStanding cable reverse \\nfly\\n2 10-12\\nTrapezius Barbell behind-the-back \\nshrug\\n4 8-10\\nAbdominals Hip thrust 3 12-15\\nCable crunch 3 12-15\\nFRIDAY\\nBack Wide-grip pulldown to \\nfront\\n3 8-10\\nOne-arm dumbbell row 3 8-10\\nT-bar row 3 8-10\\nReverse-grip pulldown 3 10-12\\nBiceps EZ bar curl 3 8-10\\nDumbbell concentra-\\ntion curl\\n3 10-12\\nAlternating hammer \\ncurl\\n3 8-10\\nForearms Dumbbell wrist curl 3 10-12\\nReverse wrist curl 3 10-12\\nTABLE 5.6 Four-Day Training Split for Pairing Like Muscle Groups\\nMONDAY\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nChest Incline bench press 3 8-10\\nDumbbell bench press 3 8-10\\nIncline dumbbell fly 3 10-12\\nCable crossover 3 10-12\\nTriceps Triceps dip 3 6-10\\nLying triceps extension 3 8-10\\nOverhead rope \\nextension\\n3 10-12\\nAbdominals Hanging leg raise 3 10-12\\nCrunch 3 15-20\\nTUESDAY\\nQuadriceps Smith machine squat 4 8-10\\nLunge 3 8-10\\nLeg extension 3 10-12\\nHamstrings Lying leg curl 3 10-12\\nRomanian deadlift 3 8-10\\nCalves Standing calf raise 3 10-12\\nSeated calf raise 3 12-15'),\n",

On the flip side of pairing muscle \\ngroups that work together is the concept of sep -\\narating muscle groups that work together. The \\nreasoning for this is that the smaller muscle group \\nis often fatigued after training the larger muscle \\ngroup. This will limit the strength of the smaller \\nmuscle group and cause it to fatigue earlier when \\ndoing exercises that target it. This in turn can limit \\ngrowth of that muscle. The option here would be to \\nsplit up the muscle groups into those that perform \\nopposite actions. For example, on Monday train \\nchest and back; Tuesday train shoulders, trape -\\nzius, and abdominals; Thursday train quadriceps, \\nhamstrings, and calves; and Friday train biceps, \\ntriceps, forearms, and abdominals, as shown in \\ntable 5.7. The Monday and Friday workouts best \\nexemplify this training strategy. Training chest \\nand back allows you to train two muscle groups \\nthat don’t fatigue each other. The same can be \\nsaid for training biceps and triceps together. Each \\nmuscle group performs an opposite motion of its \\ntraining pair. The biceps flex the elbow while the \\ntriceps extend it. Not only does this help to prevent \\nfatigue of the second muscle group trained, but it \\ncan also enhance muscle strength, as explained \\nin chapter 9, with the technique known as \\nfront-\\nto-back training.\\nTHURSDAY\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nQuadriceps Squat 3 6-8\\nLeg press 3 8-10\\nStep-up 3 8-10\\nLeg extension 3 10-12\\nHamstrings Standing leg curl 3 10-12\\nCalves Smith machine calf \\nraise\\n3 10-12\\nSeated calf raise 3 12-15\\nFRIDAY\\nBiceps Alternating dumbbell \\ncurl\\n3 8-10\\nLying cable curl 3 8-10\\nDumbbell preacher curl 3 8-10\\nForearms Reverse-grip curl 3 10-12\\nBehind-the-back wrist \\ncurl\\n3 10-12\\nTriceps Close-grip bench press 3 6-10\\nTriceps pressdown 3 8-10\\nOne-arm overhead \\ndumbbell extension\\n3 10-12\\nAbdominals Exercise-ball crunch 3 10-12\\nReverse crunch 3 12-15\\nTABLE 5.7 Four-Day Training Split for Pairing Opposite Muscle Groups\\nMONDAY\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nChest Smith machine bench \\npress\\n3 8-10\\nIncline dumbbell press 8-10\\nDumbbell fly 3 10-12\\nPec deck 3 10-12\\nBack Pull-up 3 6-10\\nReverse-grip barbell row 3 6-8\\nSeated cable row 3 8-10\\nWide-grip pulldown 3 10-12\\nTUESDAY\\nShoulders Dumbbell shoulder \\npress\\n3 8-10\\nSmith machine upright \\nrow\\n3 8-10\\nOne-arm cable lateral \\nraise\\n3 10-12\\nBent-over lateral raise 3 10-12\\nTrapezius Barbell shrug 4 6-8\\nAbdominals Incline sit-up 3 12-15\\nOblique crunch 3 12-15'),\n",

Typi-\\ncally, most bodybuilders who train twice a day train \\none muscle group earlier in the day and one muscle \\ngroup later in the day (see table 5.9). The break \\nbetween the two training sessions usually is at least \\nsix hours. Depending on your goal, this allows you \\nto either train more frequently or get more complete \\nrest days. With twice-a-day training you can train \\nall the major muscle groups of the body in three or \\nfour days. This means you can get either three or \\nfour days of rest each week if you train the muscle \\ngroups once per week. However, this method also \\nallows you to train each muscle group up to twice \\nper week. Another way to use twice-a-day training \\nis to follow a typical five-day training split that \\nincorporates a not-so-typical twist: train the same \\nmuscle group twice per day. According to research, \\nthis may be a beneficial way to train muscles.

The training split you use will influence fac-\\ntors such as the number of exercises you perform \\nand the total number of sets you do per muscle \\ngroup. But generally speaking, your training split \\ndoes not have to influence the type of exercises \\nyou choose, the amount of weight used, the number \\nof reps performed, or the amount of rest you allow \\nbetween sets. Therefore, there are general rules \\nto consider when designing a strength training \\nprogram, regardless of the spilt you are employing.\\nIf your goal is to maximize muscle mass, then \\nyour most important rule has to deal with taking \\nall sets to muscle failure. Although the sweet \\nspot for muscle growth is said to be in the range \\nof 8 to 12 reps, newer research from McMaster \\nUniversity in Canada suggests that the amount \\nof weight and rep range used may not matter \\nas much as once proposed as long as sets are \\ntaken to muscle failure. One of their studies \\nreported that participants training for 10 weeks \\nusing weights that allowed them to complete 20 \\nto 30 reps and taking each set to muscle failure \\ngained as much muscle mass as those training \\nwith weights that limited them to 8 to 12 reps per \\nset and taking each set to muscle failure (Burd \\net al. 2010). Other studies done by this group \\ndemonstrate that the higher rep ranges (20-30) \\nwith light weight taken to muscle failure increase \\nmuscle protein synthesis to an equivalent amount \\nor even better than lower rep ranges (4-5 reps) \\ntaken to muscle failure (Burd et al. 2011). So \\nthe smartest plan of attack is to cycle through a \\nvariety of rep ranges from very low (3-5 per set) \\nwith heavy weight to very high (20-30+ per set) \\nwith light weight, and a multitude of rep ranges \\nin between, such as 6 to 8 per set, 9 to 11 per \\nset, and 12 to 15 per set. This way you get the \\nbenefit that each rep range imparts, aside from \\nthe direct influence on muscle protein synthesis. \\nFor example, heavier-weight workouts have been \\nshown to increase testosterone levels higher \\nthan workouts with lighter weight. Testosterone \\nis an anabolic hormone that initiates the process \\nof muscle growth. However, higher reps, such as \\n15 or more, are associated with a higher rate of \\nrelease of growth hormone compared to workouts \\ninvolving heavier weight. Because growth hor -\\nmone is involved in muscle growth, maximizing \\nits release after a workout can be critical. Higher \\nreps also enhance the capillarization of muscle \\nfibers. That is, the amount of blood vessels that \\nsupply the muscles increases with higher-repeti -\\ntion training. By increasing the number of blood \\nvessels that supply a muscle fiber, there is an \\naccompanying increase in the delivery of blood \\nto the muscle fibers. Enhancing blood flow to \\nthe muscle fibers increases the supply of critical \\nnutrients for energy and growth such as carbohy-\\ndrate, amino acids from protein, and fat. There \\nalso is greater provision of oxygen. Oxygen not \\nonly is essential for muscle energy for recovery \\nbetween sets but is also critical for lessening the \\nindirect muscle damage that follows a weightlift-\\ning workout. Another benefit of increased blood \\nflow to muscle fibers is the greater supply of \\nanabolic hormones, such as testosterone and \\ngrowth hormone, to the muscles.\\nThe order in which you cycle the rep ranges \\nmay not be critical. Periodized models using linear \\nschemes, reverse linear schemes, and undulating \\nschemes have all been effective in producing \\nmuscle growth. So a variety of periodized programs \\nthat cycle a variety of rep ranges but take each \\nworking set to failure appear to be the best tactic \\nfor focusing on muscle growth.\\nAnother important consideration for building \\nmuscle mass is the rest time allowed between \\nsets. Most bodybuilders use shorter rest periods \\nof around one to two minutes. Shorter rest peri -\\nods—those that are two minutes or less—have \\nalso been shown to increase the surge of growth \\nhormone that follows a weightlifting workout. \\nShorter rest periods also increase the capillariza-\\ntion of the muscles as well as enhance the activity \\nof enzymes that are involved in energy supply to \\nthe muscle. One study reported that participants \\nfollowing an eight-week strength-training program \\nwho decreased the rest period between sets by 15 \\nseconds every week had greater gains in muscle \\nmass than those keeping rest periods steady at \\n2 minutes (Souza-Junior et al. 2011). See chapter \\n6 for programs that decrease rest period between \\nsets over time.\\nExercise selection and order of those exer -\\ncises are other important things to consider for \\nbuilding muscle mass. For larger muscle groups \\nthat employ several multijoint exercises, such as'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\n53Tactics for Building Muscle Mass\\nthe chest, back, shoulders, and legs, you should \\nprimarily do those multijoint exercises early in \\nthe workout when the muscle is strongest. Then \\nfollow those exercises with isolation exercises \\nthat involve movement at one single joint and best \\nisolate the targeted muscle group. The reason for \\nthis is that multijoint exercises recruit the help of \\nother muscle groups to perform the exercise. The \\ntargeted muscle group of that exercise is consid-\\nered the primary mover, while the muscle groups \\nthat help the primary mover perform the exercise \\nare considered assistance muscles. An example \\nof this is the bench press, a multijoint exercise \\nfor the chest. In the bench press, the chest is \\nconsidered the primary mover while the shoulders, \\ntriceps, and even the lats are considered the \\nassistance muscles. Because multijoint exercises \\ninvolve synergy of several muscle groups, you can \\nlift more weight with multijoint exercises. It is a \\ngood idea to do the exercises that you can lift \\nthe most weight with first. This is when all the \\nmuscles used in that exercise are freshest and \\ntherefore can all help to lift the greatest amount \\nof weight they are capable of lifting. Using more \\nweight places more overload on the target mus -\\ncles, which can lead to increased muscle hyper -\\ntrophy over time. All that said, on occasion it’s \\na good idea to flip this rule on its head and use \\nthe training technique known as preexhaust. With \\nthis technique you do the single-joint exercises \\nfor a muscle group first in the workout and the \\nmultijoint exercises last. For more on preexhaust \\nand why it works and to see a program that uses \\nit, go to chapter 6.\\nFor gains in strength, the general consensus \\namong experts is that fewer sets tend to be \\nbest. But there is some debate over the ideal \\nvolume—or total sets—to use for optimizing \\ngains in muscle mass. One reason may be that \\nthere is no ideal number of sets for increasing \\nmuscle mass. In general, beginners should start \\nout with fewer sets and gradually increase them \\nas their training experience progresses. But when \\nyou consider experienced bodybuilders, there are \\nfew generalizations that can be made in regard \\nto volume. Some bodybuilders train with very low \\nvolume (6 to 10 total sets per muscle group), while \\nothers use extremely high volume (20 to 30 total \\nsets per muscle group), as did the most famous \\nbodybuilder of all time, Arnold Schwarzenegger. \\nOne bit of advice for advanced lifters is to cycle \\ntraining volume from periods of low volume to high \\nvolume. This will depend on the training intensity \\nas well as the training frequency.\\nJust remember that these are general guidelines \\nfor building a solid foundation for your training pro-\\ngram. Many of the methods you will read about in \\nchapter 6 contradict these guidelines. The reason \\nis that the techniques presented in chapter 6 are \\ntechniques for those with moderate to extensive \\ntraining experience. For experienced lifters, chang-\\ning the convention from time to time better enables \\nmuscle growth because of the radical change in \\nthe training program.\\nChanging Your Split\\nNo matter the training split that currently is your best fit, you should consider changing your split to \\noffer your body some variety in the way you train it. Just as it is important to change your weight and \\nreps or rest time between sets, altering how you split up your training is another way to maintain con-\\ntinual progress in training adaptations and avoid stagnation. For beginners, starting on a whole-body \\ntraining split and then slowly progressing to splits that allow more volume to be done for each muscle \\ngroup is a necessity. See the table for a suggested succession of training splits based on training \\nexperience. Start with the split that corresponds to your level of training experience and progress to \\nthe next split as you reach a new level of training experience.\\nTraining experience (months) Optimal training split\\n1 to 3 Whole-body training split\\n4 to 9 Upper- and lower-body training split or two-day training split\\n10 to 18 Three-day training split \\n19+ Four- or five-day training split'),\n",

This consists of the upper pecto-\\nralis major and lower pectoralis major (see figure \\n5.1). The pectoralis muscles perform movements \\nsuch as horizontal adduction of the upper arms, \\nas in the dumbbell fly. For detailed descriptions \\nof chest exercises, refer to chapter 14. Basic, \\nmultijoint exercises for the chest involve pressing \\nmovements, such as the bench press, incline \\ndumbbell press, and push-up. Isolation exercises \\nfor the chest are flylike exercises that involve move-\\nment of the arms without any change occurring at \\nthe elbow joint. Examples of isolation exercises for \\nthe chest include the dumbbell fly, cable crossover, \\nand pec deck.

Each head has a \\ndistinct attachment on the upper end, but they \\nall meet at one common tendon that crosses the \\nelbow and attaches on the ulna. Contracting the \\ntriceps results in extension at the elbow such as \\nthe motion the arm makes when hammering.\\nThe two types of triceps exercises are compound \\nmovements and isolation movements. Compound \\ntriceps exercises involve extension at the elbow \\nand movement at the shoulder. These include \\nclose-grip bench presses and dips. Isolation tri-\\nceps exercises involve just extension at the elbow \\nwith no other joint movement, such as dumbbell \\nkickbacks. When choosing triceps exercises, you \\nshould include some compound exercises, which \\nare beneficial for adding on overall triceps mass, \\nas well as a good variety of isolation exercises. \\nThe isolation exercises you choose should hit the \\nthree different triceps heads.

The two heads are \\nthe long head (or outer head) and the short head \\n(or inner head). The major difference between \\nthem is where each muscle attaches on the \\nscapula (shoulder blade). The tendon of the long \\nhead attaches farther back on the scapula than \\nthe short head. This is why they are referred to \\nas \\nlong head and short head. Both biceps heads \\nconverge into one tendon near the elbow, and \\nthis attaches to the radius to cause flexion of the \\nelbow when the muscles contract, such as when \\ncurling a dumbbell.\\nTo flex the elbow, the biceps brachii receives help \\nfrom the assistance muscle called the brachialis. \\nThis muscle lies underneath the biceps muscles \\nand starts at the humerus (upper arm bone) and \\nattaches to the ulna. The bulk of this muscle is \\nlower than the bulk of the biceps muscle, which \\nallows it to offer the most help during the first 30 \\ndegrees of elbow flexion. The brachialis is also \\nstrongly involved in elbow flexion when the hands \\nmaintain an overhand grip on the bar. The brachio-\\nradialis, although considered a forearm muscle, \\nalso helps at the initiation of elbow flexion. It is \\nstrongly involved in elbow flexion when the hand is \\nin a neutral position, such as during hammer curls.\\nWith the exception of underhand chin-ups, there \\nare no compound exercises for biceps. Even the \\nunderhand chin-up is considered a back exercise. \\nTherefore, almost all true biceps exercises are \\nsingle-joint or isolation exercises. However, the \\nexercises you choose should stress the different \\nbiceps heads as well as the brachialis, which helps \\nto make the biceps appear larger (particularly the \\nlower portion) when it is properly developed. For \\ndetailed descriptions of all biceps exercises, refer \\nto chapter 19. For basic guidelines for designing \\nbiceps workouts based on the current training split \\nused, see table 5.14.

Though you do not need to famil-\\niarize yourself with all the different forearm muscles \\nshown in figure 5.7, you should recognize the differ-\\nence in those referred to as the wrist flexor group \\nand those referred to as the wrist extensor group. \\nThe wrist flexor group is composed of forearm mus-\\ncles that perform wrist flexion—the movement of the \\npalms toward the inner forearm, such as during a \\nwrist curl. The wrist extensors, on the other hand, \\nare involved in performing wrist extension—moving \\nthe back of the hand toward the back of the forearm, \\nsuch as when you twist the throttle on a motorcycle.\\nIt is wise to train the forearms after the biceps \\nbecause they are used so strongly during all \\nbiceps exercises. Typically, choosing one wrist \\ncurl (flexion) exercise and one reverse wrist curl \\n(extension) exercise is sufficient for working the \\nforearm muscles after biceps, especially if reverse-\\ngrip or hammer-grip curls were performed. If grip \\nstrength is a limiting factor on back and biceps \\nexercises, including a specific grip exercise may be \\nwarranted. The grip exercise should be done before \\nthe wrist curl and reverse wrist curl exercises. For \\na complete listing and detailed descriptions of all \\nforearm exercises, see chapter 20.

The vastus lateralis, vastus \\nmedialis, vastus intermedius, and rectus femoris \\nall originate from different attachment points on \\nthe thigh and hip bone, but they all converge on one \\ncommon tendon to perform knee extension, such \\nas when you kick a ball (see figure 5.8). Because \\nthe rectus femoris originates on the hipbone, not \\nthe femur (thigh bone) as with the other three quad-\\nriceps muscles, it also is involved in hip flexion, \\nsuch as when you lift your knee up. Although all \\nfour muscles work together to straighten the knee, \\ncertain exercises are better for targeting specific \\nparts of the quad. For instance, the leg extension \\nbest targets the rectus femoris muscle. However, \\ndoing leg extensions with the toes turned in places \\nmore stress on the outer quad (vastus lateralis), \\nand doing leg extensions with the toes pointed \\nout better targets the inner quads (vastus media-\\nlis). The leg press hits all four quad muscles, but \\nresearch shows that the emphasis is on the medi-\\nalis muscle. Conversely, the hack squat tends to \\nplace more emphasis on the outer quads (vastus \\nlateralis). Squats and lunges, however, hit the \\nfour quadriceps muscles fairly evenly, along with \\nthe leg adductors, hamstrings, gluteus maximus, \\nand other muscles. For detailed descriptions of all \\nquadriceps exercises, see chapter 21.\\nFor maximizing leg size, you should start your \\nquadriceps workout with one or two squat exercises \\n(with barbells, Smith machine, or dumbbells) or leg \\npress exercises, depending on the type of split you \\nare training with. These exercises are compound \\nexercises that involve extension at the knees and \\nhips. Therefore, they use not only the quadriceps \\nmuscles but also the hamstring and gluteus max-\\nimus muscles (powerful hip extensors). Because \\nthese large muscle groups work together to perform \\nthe exercise, they provide great strength. This is \\nthe reason that these exercises should be at the \\nbeginning of your leg workout. You should train \\nthese muscles when they are at their strongest so \\nthat the greatest amount of weight can be used for \\nstimulating the most muscle growth.\\nWith the squat and leg press exercises you \\nshould routinely alter your foot position to slightly \\nchange the specific muscle fibers that are used \\nduring the exercise.

It also is \\npossible to reduce the emphasis on the quadriceps \\nand increase the emphasis on the hamstrings and \\ngluteus maximus by moving the feet farther forward \\nfrom the hips. The farther the feet are placed in \\nfront of the hips, the greater the stress placed on \\nthe hamstrings and gluteus maximus and the less \\nstress the quadriceps receive.\\nThe leg press, on the other hand, reduces the \\namount of stress placed on the hamstrings and \\ngluteus maximus and maximizes the stress placed \\non the quadriceps; the majority of stress hits the \\nvastus medialis muscle. This is due to the seated \\nposition of the angled leg press. The seated posi-\\ntion keeps the hips flexed at about 90 degrees \\nwhen the legs are fully extended. Since the ham-\\nstrings and gluteus maximus are involved in exten-\\nsion of the hips during compound leg movements, \\ntheir involvement is minimized on the leg press. \\nIt’s optimal to include some form of lunging or \\nstepping exercises to train the legs unilaterally. \\nBecause these exercises are compound move -\\nments done one leg at a time, they require a \\nlot of stabilization from small and large muscle \\ngroups. That means they use most of the leg \\nmuscles including the quads, hamstrings, glutes, \\nand adductor and abductor muscles. Not only do \\nthese types of exercises help develop overall size \\nof the thigh muscles, but they also build functional \\nstrength, which transfers to more strength on other \\nexercises, such as squats.\\nThe only type of isolation exercise for quadriceps \\nis leg extension exercises, where the only move -\\nment that occurs is extension at the knee. This \\nfocuses a good deal of the stress on the rectus \\nfemoris muscle, although you can encourage more \\ninvolvement from the vastus lateralis or vastus \\nmedialis by altering the position of the feet, as \\ndescribed previously. You should perform leg \\nextension exercises at the end of the quadriceps \\nworkout after you perform the more demanding \\ncompound exercises. However, some bodybuild -\\ners prefer to warm up their quads before heavy \\ncompound exercises by doing several light sets of \\nleg extensions.

The gluteus maximus, also referred to \\nas the \\nglutes, are the large buttock muscles. The \\nglutes are involved in extending the legs back \\n(as when standing up from a seated position) \\nand kicking the legs back behind the body. The \\nhamstrings are composed of the biceps femoris, \\nthe semitendinosus, and the semimembranosus. \\nCollectively the hamstring muscles not only flex \\nthe knee, as when you bend your knee, but they \\nalso work in conjunction with the glutes to extend \\nthe legs at the hips (see figure 5.9).\\nAlthough compound quadriceps exercises like \\nthe squat, hack squat, lunge, and step-up are tra-\\nditionally considered quadriceps exercises, they \\nalso largely involve the glutes and the hamstring \\nmuscles. For this reason, most bodybuilders per-\\nform fewer hamstring exercises than quadriceps \\nexercises.\\nEven though the hamstrings involve three dif -\\nferent muscles that work together to perform leg \\nflexion and hip extension, specific exercises better \\ntarget each muscle. The Romanian deadlift hits the \\nentire hamstring fairly evenly along with the glutes \\nbecause of the hip extension involved in this exer-\\ncise. The biceps femoris is better targeted with \\nlying and standing leg curls. The semitendinosus \\nand semimembranosus, on the other hand, are \\nbetter targeted with seated leg curls. Therefore, \\na thorough hamstring workout should include one \\nexercise that involves hip extension (such as the \\nRomanian deadlift) and knee flexion (such as the \\nleg curl). For a complete listing and detailed descrip-\\ntions of all hamstring exercises, see chapter 22. If \\nfollowing a whole-body training split, you may forfeit \\nspecific hamstring exercises since the compound \\nquadriceps exercises also use the hamstrings \\nand glutes very strongly.

These muscles are the gastrocnemius \\n(a muscle shaped like an upside-down heart) and \\nthe soleus (a muscle that lies underneath the \\ngastrocnemius), as shown in figure 5.10. Both \\nmuscles perform extension at the ankle, such as \\nwhen you stand up on your toes.\\nCertain exercises are better than others at \\ntargeting the two calf muscles. For detailed \\ndescriptions of all calf exercises, refer to chapter \\n23. Standing calf raises, or any calf raise that \\ninvolves a fairly straight knee, is better at focusing \\nthe stress to the gastrocnemius. The soleus, on \\nthe other hand, is better targeted with seated calf \\nraises or any calf raise that is performed with the \\nknee bent to about 90 degrees.\\nThe best way to train calves is to include one \\nor two exercises that target the gastrocnemius \\nmuscle and one exercise that targets the soleus \\nmuscle. Most bodybuilders train their calves after \\nthighs. Some also include a second or third work-\\nout of the calves if they do not train legs twice a \\nweek. The reason for this is that the calves, partic-\\nularly the soleus, are made up of a slightly higher \\npercentage of slow-twitch muscle fibers. These \\nmuscle fibers have a high-endurance capacity and \\nrecover more quickly than fast-twitch muscle fibers. \\nThis is also the reason that many bodybuilders \\ntrain their calves with very high reps (20 to 30 reps \\nper set). However, the best way to train calves is \\nwith the use of a periodized program that cycles \\nthe number of reps performed.

These include the rectus abdominis, the \\nexternal obliques, the internal obliques, and the \\ntransverse abdominis (see figure 5.11). The best \\nabdominal program uses exercises that target all \\nfour areas of the abdominal region—upper abs, \\nlower abs, internal and external obliques, and the \\ntransverse abdominis.\\nThe upper abs are best targeted with crunch \\nexercises that involve flexing the upper spine \\nforward by bringing the shoulders toward the \\nhips, such as the standard crunch. The lower \\nabdominals are best trained with exercises that \\ninvolve flexing the lower spine forward by bringing \\nthe knees toward the chest, such as hanging knee \\nraises. Both the internal and external obliques are \\nbest targeted by exercises that flex the spine later-\\nally to the left and right, such as oblique crunches. \\nThey also are targeted with exercises that involve \\nflexing the spine forward and rotating it to the left \\nor right, such as with crossover crunches. The deep \\ntransverse abdominis is best trained with core \\nexercises that force the flexing of the transverse \\nabdominis (pulling the navel in toward the spine) \\nto stabilize the spine and pelvis.

This is because \\nthe abdominals are postural muscles that stay \\nflexed for long periods to support the spine. There-\\nfore, they tend to be slightly higher in slow-twitch \\nmuscle fibers than the other muscle groups. Most \\nbodybuilders train the abdominals a minimum of \\nthree times per week and some train them every \\nday. For most people, training abdominals on two \\nor three nonconsecutive days per week will suffice. \\nBecause the abdominals are often trained with no \\nmore resistance than the person’s body weight, \\nthey are frequently trained with reps in the range \\nof 15 to 30. However, even abdominal training \\nshould be periodized to cycle the rep range and \\nresistance used. Although many people fear that \\nusing heavy resistance on ab exercises will make \\nthe waist too big and blocky, it is essential to train \\nthe abdominal muscles like any other muscle \\ngroup. Increasing the development of the abdom-\\ninal muscles improves definition, when body fat is \\nlow. It also helps to increase core strength, which \\ncan cross over to help increase overall strength.\\nThe best way to train the abdominals is by \\nchoosing four exercises that each target a dif -\\nferent area of the abdominals for each workout. \\nHowever, if you train with a whole-body, upper- and \\nlower-body, or two-day training split, you won’t have \\nthe time to do four separate abdominal exercises. \\nIn this case, you should choose one or two exer -\\ncises that target one area of the abdominals and \\nrotate the abdominal region trained for every work-\\nout.

But one problem that arises \\nfrom consistency is that the muscles quickly adapt \\nto a workout when it is used for too long. To prevent \\nmuscle adaptation from turning into stagnation, you \\nneed to frequently expose your muscles to different \\ntraining techniques. Having numerous techniques \\nto draw from allows you to continually provide new \\ntraining stimuli to your muscles for optimal growth. \\nThis chapter presents training methods that are \\neffective for maximizing muscle mass.\\nThe techniques are categorized by the type of \\nacute variable of training that is being manipulated \\nin each workout. Each technique is rated on a scale \\nof 1 to 5 for four critical areas:\\n1. Time—the amount of time that a specific \\nworkout typically takes to complete. This \\nhelps you immediately determine whether \\nthis training technique will fit your training \\nschedule. The higher the number, the \\nlonger the workouts for that specific tech-\\nnique will take to complete.\\n2. Length—the amount of time required for \\nfollowing the program consistently before \\nappreciable results are noticeable. This \\nhelps you determine whether you have the \\npatience required in order for a certain pro-\\ngram to demonstrate results. The higher \\nthe number, the longer you must follow \\nthis technique in order to realize results.\\n3. Difficulty —the amount of weightlifting \\nexperience required for using the program \\neffectively. This helps you decide whether \\nyou have enough training experience to \\ntake on specific training techniques. The \\nhigher the number, the more training exper-\\nience you should have before attempting \\nthat particular technique.\\n4. Results—how effective the program seems \\nto be for mass gains in most people. This \\nhelps you estimate how much muscle \\nmass you can expect to gain with each pro-\\ngram. The higher the number, the greater \\ngains in muscle mass you can expect from \\na particular program.\\nEach training technique provides a sample work-\\nout to give you an indication of how the particular \\ntechnique can be used. Some provide details on \\nexercise selection, rep ranges, total sets, and \\ntraining frequency that you need to follow closely. \\nHowever, others offer just a snapshot for one \\nparticular workout or one workout cycle. These \\nare just templates, and you are encouraged to \\nsubstitute your own exercises where warranted \\nto maintain variety.\\nAlthough you need not use every method listed \\nin this chapter, if you have more than a year of train-\\ning experience, you should eventually try a majority \\nof the methods to determine those that work best \\nfor you. Then you can cycle these techniques, \\nalong with the basic programs covered in chapter \\n5, to create a periodized program that delivers the \\ndesired results and prevents the muscles from \\nstagnating. Chapter 7 covers periodized schedules \\nfor building muscle mass using the programs and \\ntechniques covered in chapters 5 and 6. In the \\nprograms, weights are given in pounds; please \\nsee appendix for metric conversions.'),\n",

This can be done \\nby increasing the number of exercises performed \\nthat make up one set, by limiting the number of \\nsets performed per muscle group, or by increasing \\nthe number of sets performed for an exercise in a \\ngiven time. They all are effective ways to increase \\nyour training intensity.\\nSuperset Training\\nSuperset training is a method that pairs exer -\\ncises for agonist and antagonist muscle groups, \\nsuch as biceps and triceps, and involves perform-\\ning a set for each muscle group back to back \\nwith no scheduled rest between exercises. See \\ntable 6.1 for sample exercise pairs that work \\nwell for supersets. Superset workouts typically \\nconsist of two or three exercise pairs for each \\nmuscle group. See table 6.2 for a sample triceps \\nand biceps superset workout. Superset train -\\ning offers several advantages over straight-set \\ntraining. The most obvious advantage is time. \\nBecause of the limited rest between exercises, \\nsuperset workouts are generally quicker to per -\\nform than other training methods that allow rest \\nperiods between sets and exercises. Another \\nadvantage of supersets is that you’ll actually be \\nstronger in the second exercise. Research has \\nfound that a muscle will be stronger if preceded \\nimmediately by a contraction of its antagonist, \\nor opposing muscle group. For example, when \\nyou do a superset of barbell curls and triceps \\nextensions, in that order, you’ll be stronger on the \\ntriceps extension and vice versa. This happens \\nbecause normally the muscle you’re training \\nis somewhat limited by its antagonist. When \\nbench-pressing using straight sets, for instance, \\nthe back muscles inhibit the contraction of your \\npecs to a certain extent. Doing a set of rows \\nshortly before benching, however, lessens this \\ninhibitory effect, allowing your pecs to contract \\nmore forcefully. As a result, you’ll be able to train \\nwith more weight and get stronger and bigger. \\nAnother benefit to superset training is enhanced \\nrecovery. When you alternate every set of triceps \\nwith a set of biceps, you increase blood flow to \\nthose muscles because when you’re doing curls, \\nyour triceps are still contracting, which increases \\nblood flow to them and aids in recovery. This \\nhelps your body remove waste products and \\ndamaged muscle tissue as a result of exercise. \\nKeep rest periods short between supersets (1 \\nto 2 minutes).\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 6.1 Superset Training Pairs\\nMuscle pair Exercises\\nChest and back Bench press and barbell \\nrow\\nShoulders and back Shoulder press and \\npull-up\\nBiceps and triceps Barbell curl and triceps \\npressdown\\nQuadriceps and \\nhamstrings\\nLeg extension and leg \\ncurl\\nTABLE 6.2 Supersets for Biceps and Triceps\\nExercise Sets Reps\\nBarbell curl 3 8-10\\nSuperset with triceps pressdown 3 8-10\\nPreacher curl 3 8-12\\nSuperset with lying triceps \\nextension\\n3 8-10\\nSeated dumbbell curl 3 8-12\\nSuperset with triceps bench dip 3 8-12'),\n",

As an example for shoulders, a \\nlifter would perform a set of shoulder presses and \\nimmediately follow that set with a set of lateral \\nraises with no break. That equals one compound \\nset. After the set of lateral raises is finished, the \\nlifter would rest for a couple of minutes and then \\nstart back with shoulder presses. This might \\nbe performed for two or three compound sets. \\nThe compound can then be followed with other \\nshoulder exercises that are performed either in \\nstraight sets or as another compound set. While \\nthe exercise choices are not that critical, there \\nare two strategies that are usually used with com-\\npound sets. Exercise choices can be made either \\nto target a different section of the desired muscle \\ngroup (such as the dumbbell shoulder press and \\nthe bent-over lateral raise) or to target a similar \\npart of the muscle group (such as the dumbbell \\nshoulder press and the machine shoulder press). \\nThe major benefits of compound-set training are \\nintensity and time. Training two exercises for one \\nmuscle group without any rest between exercises \\nsignificantly increases the intensity of the workout \\nand places greater demands on the muscle fibers \\nbeing trained as well as on your entire body. It also \\ndramatically reduces the amount of time required \\nto train a muscle group. This makes it a great work-\\nout technique when you want to push a particular \\nmuscle group beyond its comfort zone or when you \\nare short on time. Because compound-set training \\nis a very high-intensity technique, you should use \\nit infrequently or for short periods, because over-\\ntraining is possible if done for too long.

It uses \\nthree exercises for the same muscle group back \\nto back with no rest between sets, as opposed to \\njust two exercises. For smaller muscle groups like \\nbiceps, triceps, and deltoids, one group of tri-sets \\nperformed for two to four sets is typically enough \\nto train the muscle group effectively. When smart \\nexercise choices are selected, one tri-set can prop-\\nerly target all areas of most major muscle groups. \\nAs with compound-set training, the major benefits \\nof tri-set training are higher-intensity training and \\nless training time required. Of course, it also means \\nthat the technique should be used infrequently and \\nfor short periods to prevent overtraining.

The difference is in the number of \\nexercises performed. Giant sets incorporate four \\nor more exercises. Giant sets or tri-sets are a great \\nway to quickly hit any muscle group from a variety \\nof angles. The benefits are similar to those of \\ncompound and tri-sets. See table 6.5 for a sample \\ngiant-set routine for abs.\\nWithout taking a rest, perform one set of each \\nexercise listed.

The foundation \\nof this training method involves very low volume \\nand very high intensity. Most followers do as few \\nas one set per exercise and only one to three exer-\\ncises per muscle group (see table 6.6). Intensity \\nfor this technique is not so much about the weight \\nused but about training beyond the point of muscle \\nfailure. Every set must be taken beyond failure \\nwith the use of forced reps, negative-rep training, \\nand even partial-rep training (where as much of \\nthe range of motion of the exercise is performed \\nuntil the weight cannot be budged). The theory \\nbehind HIT is that if multiple sets of an exercise \\nare performed, every set cannot be trained with \\nmaximal intensity. By doing one and only one set \\nof an exercise, you have a better chance of training \\nwith maximal intensity.\\nVolume is also kept low with HIT to minimize \\nthe time spent in the gym. Because volume is low \\nwith HIT , it allows the lifter to follow a whole-body \\ntraining split or a two-day training split, depending \\non whether the lifter wants to train each muscle \\ngroup two or three times per week.\\nThere is no research to specifically support the \\ntheory of HIT , and anecdotal reports are varied. \\nSome lifters experience considerable gains in \\nstrength and muscle mass. But for most, the \\nprogress soon comes to a halt. The problem may \\nlie in the fact that volume is an acute variable \\nthat does not get manipulated in this program. \\nTherefore, following HIT for only four to six weeks \\nwould be a smart way to use it. After training with \\nHIT you should switch to a training program that \\nuses fairly high volume. The sample HIT program \\nin table 6.6 is a two-day split done twice a week. \\nIn this program, each set should be preceded with \\none short warm-up set before each exercise with \\napproximately 50 percent of the weight you will use \\nfor the main working set. Do only about four to six \\nreps with this lighter weight. Perform each set to \\nmuscle failure and have a spotter help you perform \\nthree or four forced reps after reaching muscle \\nfailure. Resist the negative portion of the forced \\nreps for added intensity and consider attempting \\na few partial reps at the very end of the set.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5'),\n",

It also requires that \\nyou do that in the same amount of time as for the \\nprevious workout. For example, if you do three sets \\nof barbell curls for 10 reps in five minutes in one \\nworkout, you must try to get four sets of 10 reps in \\nfive minutes in the following workouts until you reach \\nthat goal. The only way to do more sets in the same \\namount of time is to reduce your rest period between \\nsets. Therefore, this method increases strength and \\nmuscle mass by enhancing the ability of the muscles \\nto recover between sets. The best way to use this \\ntechnique is to do it first in your workout using one \\nexercise for each muscle group.

The following training techniques alter the \\nreps performed in each workout. This can be done \\nby using specific rep ranges, using extremely high-\\nrep training, dividing the reps up throughout the \\nday, altering the range of motion of specific reps, \\nperforming reps with additional help after muscles \\nhave fatigued, changing the speed at which reps \\nare performed, or emphasizing a certain part of \\nthe rep. These all work to boost muscle growth \\none rep at a time.\\n5–10–20 Training\\nThis program is actually an advanced version of \\ntri-sets (see Tri-Set Training earlier in this chapter). \\nWith most tri-set programs you perform equal reps \\non all three exercises, but this one uses very spe-\\ncific repetition ranges for each exercise. The first \\nexercise in the tri-set is done for just 5 reps. This \\nis a good rep range for boosting muscle strength. \\nThe second exercise is done for 10 reps. This is \\nthe ideal rep range for building muscle mass. The \\nlast exercise in the tri-set is done for 20 reps. This \\nrep range enhances muscle endurance but also \\nfurther promotes muscle hypertrophy. Combining \\nall three of these rep ranges gives you a program \\nthat trains the muscles in every respect necessary \\nto get them big, lean, and strong.\\nExercise selection plays an important role in \\nthe 5–10–20 program because of the imposed \\nrep ranges. The first exercise should be a basic \\nexercise, preferably using a barbell. Because \\nthe reps on this exercise are so low for building \\nstrength, basic multijoint exercises with a barbell \\nare best (see table 6.8 for sample exercise choices \\nfor each exercise). The second exercise is done \\nwith a moderate number of reps for putting on \\nmuscle size; therefore, it should be another basic \\nexercise (similar to the first) but performed with \\neither dumbbells or a machine. The third exercise \\nis the high-rep set, so the best exercise choices \\nare single-joint isolation moves. These can be done \\nwith dumbbells, but cables or machines are your \\npreferred method to give your muscles continuous \\ntension throughout the entire range of motion.\\nBecause this program is so demanding on the \\nmuscles and on your entire body, you’ll need to \\nget plenty of rest for optimal recovery. Allow each \\nmuscle group trained with the 5–10–20 program at \\nleast five days of rest before training them again. \\nI suggest you plan on working each muscle group \\njust once per week, as shown in table 6.9. Remem-\\nber that you can substitute these exercises for any \\nof the appropriate ones in table 6.8. Perform one \\nset of each exercise, resting just long enough to get \\nset up on the next exercise. After the last exercise \\nis completed, rest two minutes before repeating in \\nthe same order. Repeat for a total of two to four \\ntri-sets. Follow the program for no longer than 6 \\nweeks. This is a fairly grueling regimen to maintain \\nfor any longer. But don’t think that you have to train \\nevery body part with 5–10–20. You can choose to \\ntrain just one or a few of your troublesome body \\nparts with the 5–10–20 program to bring them up \\nto par with the rest of you.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5'),\n",

The weight \\nyou will use to complete 100 reps is around 20 to \\n30 percent of a weight you can use for 10 strict \\nreps. For example, if you use 50-pound dumbbells \\nfor 10 reps on dumbbell curls, you will use 10- to \\n15-pound dumbbells when you do hundreds train-\\ning. Try the 10-pound dumbbells to start, because \\nyou always want to start lighter than heavier. \\nYour goal is to perform at least 70 reps before \\nyou stop for a quick breather. That is, you should \\nfail before you reach 100 reps. If you can do all \\n100 reps with a given weight, without stopping, \\nthen the weight is too light and you will need to \\nincrease it for the next workout. You need to find \\na weight that allows you to complete 60 to 70 \\nreps without stopping. Your mark for increasing \\nthe weight is when you can get 70 reps or more \\nwith a weight.\\nLet’s walk through a sample set of standing \\ndumbbell curls using the hundreds training \\napproach. Grab your appropriately weighted \\ndumbbells and perform dumbbell curls as you \\nnormally would with a heavier weight. Keep your \\nform on the dumbbell curls strict as described in \\nchapter 19 and keep your reps moderately paced \\nand under control at all times. If you chose the \\ncorrect weight, you will reach momentary muscle \\nfailure somewhere between rep 60 and rep 70. \\nHere’s where you get a rest but only for as many \\nseconds as the number of reps you have left to \\ncomplete. In other words, rest 1 second for every \\nremaining rep you have left. If you completed 65 \\nreps, then you rest 35 seconds, and then attempt \\nto do the remaining 35 reps. If you fail to com -\\nplete those final 35, use the same method—rest \\n1 second for every rep you have left until you \\nreach the 100-rep mark. Sounds simple . . . until \\nyou actually try it. This method is only for those \\nwith at least one full year of consistent strength \\ntraining experience.\\nThe benefit of hundreds training is how it \\nincorporates the muscle fibers in the muscle. \\nBecause the weight is so light and the reps \\nare so high, it thoroughly trains the slow-twitch \\nmuscle fibers in the beginning of the set. All \\nmuscles are composed of two major types \\nof muscle fibers—slow-twitch and fast-twitch \\nmuscle fibers. Slow-twitch muscle fibers tend \\nto be used for endurance-type activities—there -\\nfore, higher reps tend to train them best. Fast-\\ntwitch muscle fibers are used for more powerful \\nactivities—therefore, they are better trained \\nwith heavy weight and low reps, or with fast, \\nexplosive-type movements. Most muscles are \\nclose to 50 percent slow-twitch and 50 percent \\nfast-twitch muscle fibers. This means it’s a good'),\n",

With hundreds training you will hit \\nthe slow-twitch muscle fibers during the first 60 \\nreps or so. After that, your muscles will have to \\ncall on the fast-twitch muscle fibers to help out \\nthe fatigued slow-twitch fibers. Doing this many \\nrepetitions causes biochemical changes in the \\nmuscle, which aid in muscle growth. It also leads \\nto greater growth of blood vessels that feed the \\nmuscle fibers to enhance the delivery of blood, \\noxygen, nutrients, and hormones to the muscle \\ncells. This environment increases the growth \\npotential of the muscle fibers.\\nThe best way to use hundreds training is to \\ntrain each muscle group twice per week. There -\\nfore, following an upper- and lower-body training \\nsplit or a two-day is ideal with this style of train -\\ning. The only difference is that you can do up to \\nthree exercises for larger muscle groups (chest, \\nback, and quadriceps) because you perform only \\none set per exercise with hundreds training. Try \\nhundreds training for about two to four weeks; it \\nis very intense and will be difficult to follow for \\nany longer. Then follow it with a standard mass \\ntraining that uses heavy weight and low reps. \\nAnother way to use hundreds training is to spo -\\nradically train one muscle group or your entire \\nbody with hundreds training for just one or two \\nworkouts to change your training style and shock \\nthe muscles for added growth. See table 6.11 for \\na sample training regimen using the hundreds \\ntraining technique. Each of the workouts in this \\nprogram is to be done twice weekly. For instance, \\nyou can do workout 1 on Monday and Thursday \\nand workout 2 on Tuesday and Friday.

Simply stated, this pro-\\ngram involves the completion of 100 reps per day \\non one exercise for any body part that you deem \\nis behind in growth. It is different from hundreds \\ntraining in that you don’t perform all 100 reps at \\none time, plus you do this for one muscle group \\nevery day for eight weeks. By doing so many reps \\nevery day, you enhance the endurance capacity of \\nthe muscle. Enhanced endurance is facilitated by \\nan increase in the capillary density of the muscle. \\nCapillary density refers to the number of capillar-\\nies (small blood vessels where nutrient and gas \\nexchange take place between the blood and the \\nmuscle cells) a muscle is supplied with. Muscle \\nhypertrophy tends to lower the capillary density \\nbecause of the greater amount of muscle present. \\nThis also happens with low-rep, heavy-weight \\ntraining, because this style of training forces the \\nmuscle to rely more on the energy it can derive \\nwithin the muscle cell, not from the blood. By \\ndoing the 50–50 method, you can boost the cap-\\nillary density of a muscle and therefore enhance \\nthe delivery of nutrients, anabolic hormones, and \\noxygen to the muscle. In addition, you enhance \\nthe removal of biochemical waste products from \\nthe muscle. This results in bigger muscle pumps, \\nmore rapid recovery of the muscle, and ultimately \\ngreater potential for muscle growth.\\nTo follow the 50–50 method, choose the muscle \\ngroup you want to bring up to par with the others. \\nThen choose one exercise for that muscle group. \\nThis will be the exercise you will do every day, \\neven on the days you don’t normally train that \\nmuscle group. See table 6.12 for a list of the best \\nexercises to use with the 50–50 method. You will \\nneed to perform 100 reps a day of that exercise \\nin two segments in the day. That means you will \\nperform 50 reps at a time, separated by about \\n8 to 12 hours, with a weight that challenges you \\nbut is not so heavy it causes you to fatigue by the \\n50th rep. For example, if you want to build up your \\nbiceps, you will do 50 reps of dumbbell curls in \\nthe morning—say at 9:00 a.m.—and again in the \\nevening—maybe at 9:00 p.m. The weight you use \\nis critical to your success. If it’s too heavy, then it \\nis likely to lead to overtraining.

Its name \\ncomes from the total number of reps per set you \\nperform with this training technique. In each set, you \\ndo a total of 21 repetitions but as three separate \\nsets of 7 reps. You start the set from the start posi-\\ntion and do 7 reps through the first half of the range \\nof motion (see table 6.13). After you complete the \\nfirst 7 reps, you do another 7 reps but only through \\nthe last half of the range of motion. When those 7 \\nare complete, you finish with 7 reps through the full \\nrange of motion of that exercise. Using the barbell \\ncurl as an example, you start with your arms fully \\nextended, holding a barbell across the front of your \\nthighs. First you curl the weight up 7 times only to \\nthe point where your arms are parallel with the floor. \\nThen you curl the weight up 7 times from the point \\nwhere your arms are parallel with the floor to the \\npoint where they are close to your shoulders. After \\nthese 7 reps, you perform 7 standard barbell curls \\ngoing through the full range of motion.\\nThe 21s can be done with virtually any exercise \\nbut are most practical with single-joint isolation \\nmovements. Multijoint exercises, like the bench \\npress and squat, involve so many secondary and \\nstabilizing muscles that straight sets prove the \\nmost effective. See table 6.13 for a sample of the \\nbest exercises to use with 21s. Regardless of the \\nexercise, you’ll need to use lighter resistance than \\nusual when doing 21s, since your muscles are unac-\\ncustomed to the increased number of reps. Using \\ncables or machines for this training technique is \\nan excellent way to maintain continuous tension on \\nthe muscle. This is especially important, because \\nthe tension on the muscle is typically decreased \\nat full flexion when you use free weights.\\nWith 21s you can most effectively work on \\nflexibility within the joint during the first 7 reps, \\nsince you begin each rep with the working muscle \\nin a fully stretched position. The middle 7 reps \\nare most productive in terms of muscle growth \\nand development, because you’re stronger in the \\nsecond half of the movement and you can squeeze \\nthe contraction at the top for maximum peaking. \\nThe last 7 reps essentially serve the purpose of \\nburning out the muscles, which is great for initiat-\\ning new growth.\\nTo work 21s into your current routine, do three \\nsets of them as the first exercise for a body part \\n(after a proper warm-up, of course), then resume \\nwith straight sets for all other movements in that \\nbody-part workout. Or do one to three sets of 21s \\nas the last exercise for a particular body part to \\nburn it out. To avoid overtraining, decrease your \\nvolume for the body part you’re doing 21s with \\nby doing one fewer exercise in that workout. If on \\nchest day you normally do three or four exercises, \\ndo two or three if you’re doing three sets of 21s. \\nBeginners should start off with only one set of \\n21s—remember, this is an advanced technique. \\nYou can increase to 2 or 3 sets after a couple of \\nsessions.

The last exer -\\ncise should be done for three sets of 16 reps to \\nprovide a significant pump to the muscle. This \\nwill drive more fluid into the muscle cells, and \\nthe stretch this provides is believed to stimulate \\nmuscle growth. This final exercise can be either \\nan isolation exercise or a basic exercise for that \\ngiven muscle group, depending on what exercise \\nwas done for the second exercise.\\nBecause of the higher volume involved with \\nthis program, you should split your workouts into \\nthree separate body regions. For instance, workout \\n1 could be chest, shoulders, triceps, and abs; \\nworkout 2 could be back and biceps; and workout \\n3 could be thighs, calves, and abs. Depending on \\nhow well you recover, you may consider training \\neach muscle group just once a week on the four-\\nrep system. An alternative way to do the four-rep \\nsystem is to perform four sets of each exercise. \\nThe first set will be done for 4 reps, the second \\nset for 8 reps, the third set for 12 reps, and the \\nlast set for 16 reps. Do this with two or three \\nexercises per muscle group.

After you can no longer \\ncomplete any more positive reps with a given \\nweight, you can still do several negative reps. \\nThis is because muscles are much stronger on \\nthe negative portion of an exercise. Negative-rep \\ntraining lets you take advantage of this fact and \\nthe fact that this high-intensity technique can spur \\nnew growth when done from time to time. Using \\nnegative-rep training for boosting muscle growth \\nis different from using negative-rep training to \\nimprove muscle strength. For using negative-rep \\ntraining to enhance muscle strength, see chapter \\n9. Resisting the weight down on the eccentric, or \\nnegative, portion of an exercise causes definite \\nmuscle damage. When muscle fibers are damaged, \\nit sets off a cascade of steps that leads to muscle \\ngrowth. It also develops protection from further \\neccentric overloading. That is why you want to use \\nthis technique infrequently. Once a tolerance for it \\nhas been built, the muscle damage is much less. \\nTherefore, stopping after you have used it once \\nor twice for a muscle group is the wisest way to \\nadd this technique to your training program. Then \\ntake a break from it for at least two months. You \\nwill need to do only two or three negative reps at \\nthe end of the last set for each exercise you do. \\nHave a spotter or two—depending on the amount \\nof weight you use—help you perform the positive \\nportion of each rep. During the negative part of \\nthe rep, you should attempt to resist the weight by \\nallowing it to slowly force your muscles through the \\nnegative repetition. It should take you no less than \\nabout three seconds to lower the weight through \\nthe negative rep. If you cannot resist the weight for \\nat least three seconds, do not perform any more \\nnegative reps and finish the set.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nNegative Repetitions\\nSlow-Repetition Training\\nSlow-repetition training is a technique in which the \\nrepetitions are performed at a very slow speed. \\nAlthough the term \\nslow-repetition training covers \\na broad spectrum of possibilities, the most pop -\\nular method is known as superslow training. This \\nmethod requires you to slow your rep speed down to \\n10 seconds on the positive portion of the lift and an \\nadditional 10 seconds on the negative portion. You \\nshould use a weight that is about 50 to 70 percent \\nof the weight you normally lift and attempt to com-\\nplete 5 to 10 reps per set. Because of the intense \\nnature of slow contractions, you need to perform \\nonly about two or three exercises per muscle group \\nand only two sets per exercise. You should also \\nallow five to seven days of rest for all major muscle \\ngroups trained with superslow training. Try this work-\\nout method for four to six weeks before changing to \\na different routine that involves normal-speed reps. \\nAnother way to incorporate superslow training into \\nyour lifting program is to do it every other workout \\nfor each muscle group or throw in one superslow rep \\nset each workout for any muscle group—do it either \\nat the beginning or at the end of the workout. There \\nare many benefits to superslow training that make \\nit an effective technique for adding muscle mass. It \\nminimizes the momentum of the weight to maximize \\nthe force placed on the muscle being trained. It \\nhelps you to develop the connection between mind \\nand muscle, because the slow movement forces \\nyou to concentrate on the muscle contraction. It \\nprogressively fatigues all the fibers of the muscles \\ninvolved. It minimizes the risk of injury from poorly \\nperformed exercise movements.

The \\nslow reps build strength by keeping muscles under \\ntension for a longer period. The longer they have \\nto support the weight, the more damaged they get, \\nand hence the more muscle they will develop. And \\nending each set with the normal reps increases \\nmuscular endurance. See table 6.16 for the Speed-\\nSet Training program.\\nEach set has 15 reps. Reps 1 to 5 are the \\nexplosive reps, executed superfast. Reps 6 to 10 \\nare excruciatingly slow, taking five seconds on the \\npositive and another five seconds on the negative. \\nAnd reps 11 to 15 are done at your normal pace \\n(or roughly 1 to 2 seconds up and the same back \\ndown). Because of the intensity of this regimen, \\nyou’ll pick a weight at which you could normally do \\n20 to 25 reps.\\nAvoid unilateral (single-arm or -leg) exercises. \\nDoing 15 reps (five of them ultraslow) per set \\ntakes a long time, and if you’re doing something \\nlike dumbbell rows or presses on each side, it \\ncould put too much strain on your stabilizer and \\ncore muscle groups. To spare your core muscles, \\nI recommend incorporating machines, particularly \\nthe Smith machine, which also allows you to exert \\nmaximum explosive power on the fast reps.\\nThis regimen is ideal for training opposing \\nmuscle groups in each workout, pairing chest with \\nback, biceps with triceps, shoulders with calves, \\nand legs with abs. That way, you ensure that each \\nmuscle group gets the full benefit of training. \\nBecause the rep level is high and the technique \\nis so intense, you could very easily burn out, say, \\nyour triceps while training your chest, making it \\nimpossible for your triceps to benefit from this \\ntype of training on the same day.\\nStart by doing two sets per exercise during \\nweeks 1 and 2 and build up to three sets per exer-\\ncise during weeks 3 and 4.

You \\nwill lift this weight for a total of four minutes, taking \\nshort rest breaks each time you reach muscle \\nfailure. The goal is to see how many reps you can \\ncomplete in these four minutes and to progressively \\nincrease the total number of reps you can complete \\nover several weeks. You should be able to complete \\nat least 40 reps in four minutes the first week you \\nuse this technique. The goal is to complete 60 reps \\nin four minutes after four to six weeks.\\nThe week before taking this journey, use all the \\nexercises as listed and find the weight on each \\nexercise that allows you to complete a minimum \\nof 15 reps and a maximum of 19 reps. The weight \\nyou select is critical to your success. A weight that \\nallows you to do fewer than 15 reps will be too \\nheavy to ever get you close to the 60-rep goal in \\nfour to six weeks. A weight that allows you to get \\nmore than 19 reps will be too easy and will enable \\nyou to reach the goal of 60 reps in less than four \\nweeks. Do only enough sets per exercise to deter-\\nmine the proper weight to use and then move on \\nto the next exercise. Do all the exercises in each \\nworkout in the order listed.\\nThere are two main ways that you can go about \\ntraining with the Four-Minute Muscle program. The \\nfirst way is to go to failure and then rest as little as \\npossible before picking up the weight and going to \\nfailure again and continuing in this fashion until the \\nfour minutes are up. The problem with this strategy \\nis that there is no way to advance the number of \\ntotal reps you can complete other than hoping that \\nyou will increase muscle endurance each time you \\ntrain this way, which should allow you to complete \\nmore reps in that four-minute window.\\nA smarter strategy is to pace yourself by sticking \\nwith a set amount of rest time between sets. The \\nfirst time you do this workout, rest 20 seconds \\nbetween sets each time you hit failure. Do this \\nagain in week 2. Then in week 3, drop your rest \\nto 15 seconds between sets each time you hit \\nmuscle failure. Do this again in week 4. If you do \\nnot hit the goal of 60 reps in week 4, drop to 10 \\nseconds of rest between sets in weeks 5 and 6, \\nand you should hit your goal of 60 reps or at least \\nvery close to 60 reps.\\nIf you don’t hit the 60-rep mark by the end of \\nthe six weeks on all exercises, don’t worry about \\nit. Hitting the 60-rep goal is not critical to the \\nresults you will have. The results you can you \\nexpect in four to six weeks on this program are \\nbigger muscle size, less body fat, and an increase \\nin muscle endurance. Muscle endurance means \\nthat you will be able to complete more reps with \\na given weight. For example, if you can complete \\n10 reps with 70-pound dumbbells on the dumbbell \\nbench press, you can expect to be getting a solid \\n12 to 15 reps with that same weight. It also means \\nyou’ll be able to use heavier dumbbells (say 75- or \\n80-pounders) to get those same 10 reps.\\nThe reason this program delivers all of this is \\nmanifold. For starters, because you are doing an \\nexercise for four minutes with minimal rest between \\nsets, you will be burning many more calories than \\nwhen you do normal sets with two to three minutes \\nof rest between sets. This will also mean you will \\nstill be burning more calories when the workout is \\nover. All of that leads to some serious fat burning. \\nTraining this way will also place your muscles under \\na lot of metabolic stress. That means you’ll be \\ncreating waste products in your muscles, such as \\nlactate. The metabolic waste products will instigate \\na higher release of anabolic hormones like growth \\nhormone, testosterone, and insulin-like growth \\nfactor-I (IGF-I), which will stimulate muscle growth. \\nPlus dealing with these waste products will train \\nyour body to better handle and dispose of them. \\nThat will increase your muscle endurance, which \\nwill result in strength increases. Going for four \\nminutes with minimal rest like this will also place \\na lot of mechanical stress on the muscles (muscle \\ndamage). That will lead to further gains in muscle \\nsize. And training this way is so unique compared \\nto how you have previously trained that it will simply \\nshock your muscles into responding by growing \\nbigger and stronger. That’s the principle known as \\nmuscle confusion. See table 6.17, Four-Minute \\nMuscle Mayhem, for the full workout.\\nTry this program for four to six weeks.

The following \\nprograms do just that—they manipulate the load, \\nor resistance. This can be done by altering sets \\nof heavy weight and light weight within a single \\nworkout or on each exercise during a workout. \\nSome of these techniques alter the weight during \\na set. Regardless of the time line, the result from \\neach of these is greater muscle mass.\\nHeavy and Light Method\\nThis technique simply incorporates several heavy \\nsets of an exercise followed by several light sets \\nof that same exercise. The theory is that the heavy \\nsets will stimulate the fast-twitch muscle fibers \\nbetter while the lighter sets promote capillarization \\nof the muscles and induce fatigue. This is often \\ndone with just one exercise, as shown in table \\n6.18. More experienced bodybuilders will some -\\ntimes do two exercises but with fewer total sets on \\neach exercise. With this method, the first exercise \\n(which is typically a basic or multijoint movement) \\nis done with heavy weight and low reps, while the \\nsecond exercise (which is often an isolation-type \\nexercise) is done with very light weight and high \\nreps (see table 6.19). For both programs, the exer-\\ncises would be completed over a three- or four-day \\nsplit.

The first two \\nor three are warm-up sets that are not taken to \\nfailure. The third or fourth set usually consists of \\na weight that allows for only four to six reps. After \\nthat set the weight is progressively lowered and the \\nreps increase for another two or three sets. See \\ntable 6.20 for a sample workout using the triangle \\nmethod. The benefit of the triangle method is that \\nit allows you to slowly prepare the targeted muscle \\nfor very heavy weight.

As with the triangle \\nmethod, you start with a very light weight for 10 \\nreps to warm up. Then you gradually increase \\nthe weights of each set by the smallest increase \\navailable (usually five pounds each dumbbell) \\nuntil you can perform only one repetition. After \\nthat, if you’re really up for punishing your muscles, \\nreverse the order and decline in weight by the \\nsmallest decrease possible until you reach your \\nstarting point. Rest between sets should be kept \\nto a minimum—about one to two minutes. The \\nbenefits of the rack pyramid method are similar \\nto those of the triangle method in that it allows a \\nproper warm-up for preparing the muscle for the \\nintense training task ahead. It also provides a \\nvery broad range of reps for a variety of training \\nstimuli to the muscle. It also gives the muscle an \\nintense workout that is sure to kick-start muscle \\ngrowth. Because this method is rather grueling \\non the targeted muscles, it’s wise to use the rack \\npyramid method infrequently. It is best thrown into \\na workout to stimulate a lagging muscle group to \\ngrow. One beneficial way to use the rack pyramid \\nmethod is to use it for one exercise per muscle \\ngroup.

Perform two more sets, \\nin which you decrease the weight each set just \\nenough to allow you to perform the same number of \\nreps as you did on the first set. After the third set, \\nyou will do two more sets, increasing the weight by \\nthe same increments by which you decreased the \\nweights previously. Because of the fatigue involved, \\nthe last two sets will likely be in the low repetition \\nrange of two to four. This is supposed to work \\nsynergistically with the higher-rep sets performed \\nin the earlier sets to enhance muscle growth. See \\ntable 6.23 for a sample inverted pyramid program. \\nThis system can be performed with any exercise \\nfor most muscle groups, but it is best performed \\nfirst in the workout with a basic exercise such as \\nthe bench press, shoulder press, squat, barbell \\ncurl, or triceps extension.

The bene-\\nfit of the Oxford method is that it allows the heaviest \\nweight to be used on the first working set before \\nthe muscles are fatigued by previous working sets \\nwith lighter weight. With this descending pyramid \\ntechnique, the first set is done with 100 percent \\nof the 10RM to failure. Of course, this should be \\npreceded by one or two light warm-up sets. On the \\nsecond and third sets the weight is reduced just \\nenough to allow you to complete 10 reps to failure. \\nThe Oxford seems to work well for gaining muscle \\nmass because each set is done to muscle failure. \\nMuscle failure is important for inducing muscle \\ngrowth. The reason is that reaching muscle failure \\nstimulates the release of growth hormone (GH) \\nand insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Although the \\nOxford method is typically described using 10 reps \\nper set, it can also be used with other rep ranges, \\nsuch as 6, 8, 12, or even 15 reps per set.

For example, if you can do 10 reps of \\nbarbell curls with 100 pounds on the bar, you would \\nfirst complete 10 reps and then put the bar down \\nto quickly strip off about 20-30 percent (or about \\n20-30 pounds). You immediately perform as many \\nreps as possible with that weight before putting it \\ndown and stripping another 20-30 percent off the \\nbar and doing more reps. This can continue as \\nmany times as you like, although most bodybuild-\\ners do one or three drops per drop set. Regardless \\nof how many drops are done per drop set, it is \\ncounted as only one set. Most bodybuilders per -\\nform about two or three drop sets per exercise. \\nChoose two exercises per muscle group, usually \\none compound exercise and one isolation exercise, \\nand do three drop sets for each. Another way to \\nuse drop-set training is to do the last set of every \\nexercise as a drop set. \\nThe benefit of drop-set training is similar to that \\nof forced-rep training in that it lets you push your \\nmuscles beyond their limits. Forcing the muscles \\nto continue contracting with lighter weight will \\ncause an elevated response of growth hormone \\nand IGF-I. The trick is to keep the rest between \\ndrops to a minimum. It’s a good idea to have a \\nspotter help you strip the weight or use dumbbells \\nfor the quickest drops in weight.

This changes the biochemical adaptations \\nthe muscles undergo by altering the type of fuel \\n(ATP , creatine phosphate, or glycogen) they rely \\non during sets and to recover with between sets. \\nThe chemicals produced from the use of different \\nfuels can stimulate certain biochemical pathways \\ninvolved in the process of muscle growth. The fol-\\nlowing programs change the rest periods between \\nsets in an effort to stimulate muscle growth. This \\ncan be done by decreasing the rest between sets \\nfrom workout to workout or by limiting the amount \\nof rest between sets.\\nRest Rundown\\nThis is a program where rest time between sets is \\nreduced by about 15 seconds every consecutive \\nworkout. The program starts with three-minute \\nrest periods between sets and progressively \\ndrops to about 15 seconds over a 12-week \\nperiod. The goal is to use the same weight for \\nthe same amount of reps each week. While that \\ndoesn’t seem like progress when looking at the \\nresistance used and the repetitions completed, \\nit is remarkable progress when considering the \\ndrastic reductions in rest time. This trains the \\nbiochemical pathways in the muscle to allow the \\nmuscle to recover faster and allows for more reps \\nto be performed with a given weight. The ability \\nto do the same number of reps with the same \\nweight with less rest time between sets translates \\nto greater muscle growth. In fact, as discussed \\nin chapter 5, research shows that participants \\nfollowing an eight-week strength-training program \\nthat decreased the rest period between sets by 15 \\nseconds every week had greater gains in muscle \\nmass than those keeping rest periods steady at \\ntwo minutes (Souza-Junior et al. 2011). Stay at \\na rest range if you cannot complete reps in the \\nunder-two-minute range. See table 6.27 for a \\nsample weekly progression of the rest rundown \\nprogram for an athlete who trains each body part \\nonce per week. Bodybuilders often use the rest \\nrundown method to prepare for competition. This \\nis believed to help with muscle definition and to \\ndecrease body fat because the workout is similar \\nto an aerobic-type workout.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 6.27 Rest Rundown\\nWeek Rest between sets \\n1 3 min\\n2 2 min 45 sec\\n3 2 min 30 sec\\n4 2 min 15 sec\\n5 2 min\\n6 1 min 45 sec\\n7 1 min 30 sec\\n8 1 min 15 sec\\n9 1 min\\n10 45 sec\\n11 30 sec\\n12 15 sec'),\n",

As \\nyou work one side of the body, the opposite side is \\nresting. You cycle back and forth from one side to \\nthe other. To do this, choose a weight that allows you \\nto complete about 6 to 8 reps. We will use one-arm \\ndumbbell curls as an example. Do 3 reps of curls on \\nthe right arm and immediately switch to the left arm \\nand do 3 reps of curls on the left arm. Then switch \\nto the right arm for 3 more reps of curls. Continue \\nin this fashion resting for 3 reps, then resting for \\n2 reps, and finally resting for 1 rep. In the end you \\ncomplete 14 reps per set with a weight you normally \\ncould do for only 6 to 8 reps. You basically double \\nthe amount of reps you can do with a given weight. \\nThat pushes not only muscle growth but muscle \\nstrength as well. And because you are using one limb \\nat a time, you are stronger than you are when you \\nuse two arms. That is, when you perform single-arm \\nexercises, like a one-arm dumbbell curl, you can curl \\nmore weight than half of what you could curl on a \\nbarbell using both arms, which leads to even greater \\ngains in muscle strength.\\nOn the last set of each exercise, do as many \\nreps as you can on the final rest that is supposed \\nto be just one rep. Not only will this increase the \\nintensity on the last set, but it will also serve as \\na barometer for the appropriateness of the weight \\nyou selected. If you can do more than one rep \\non the final rest of the final set of an exercise, \\nincrease the weight by 5 to 10 pounds the next \\nworkout. If you can complete only one rep on the \\nfinal rest of the final set, then the weight you \\nselected is perfect. If you can’t complete the final \\nrep on the final set, then during the next workout \\nreduce the weight by 5 to 10 pounds. If you can’t \\ncomplete the final rep on any of the first two sets, \\nthen reduce the weight by 5 to 10 pounds on the \\nnext set.\\nFollow the Alternating Rest-Pause program in \\ntable 6.28 for four weeks and then switch to a \\nnew training program.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nAlternating Rest-Pause Program\\n> continued\\nTABLE 6.28 Alternating Rest-Pause Program\\nMONDAY: CHEST, TRICEPS, ABS\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nChest One-arm dumbbell \\nbench press*\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nSmith machine one-arm \\nincline bench press\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nOne-arm low pulley \\ncable crossover\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nOne-arm cable \\ncrossover\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nTriceps One-arm triceps \\npressdown\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nOne-arm lying triceps \\nextension\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nOne-arm dumbbell \\noverhead extension\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nAbs*\\n* Do your normal ab workout here.\\nTUESDAY: LEGS\\nMuscle \\ngroup Exercise Sets Reps\\nLegs One-leg press 3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nSmith machine reverse \\nlunge\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nDumbbell step-up 3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nOne-leg extension 3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nOne-leg curl 3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nCalves One-leg calf raise 3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1\\nOne-leg seated calf \\nraise\\n3 3, 3, 3, \\n2, 2, 1'),\n",

Typical \\ncircuit training involves the use of machines and very \\nlight weight. What they both have in common is that \\nthe goal is to move from one exercise to the next with \\nno scheduled rest between exercises. Instead of doing \\nseveral sets for an exercise, you would do only one set \\nof an exercise before moving to a new exercise. In the \\nend, you will complete several sets of each exercise \\nafter running through the circuit several times.\\nPower circuits are designed to increase strength \\nand muscle size while helping decrease body fat. \\nThe continuous movement of circuit training keeps \\nyour metabolism high through the whole workout. \\nResearch studies show that keeping rest periods \\nunder 30 seconds burns the most calories regardless \\nof how much weight is used and how many reps are \\nperformed. Research also suggests that fat use by \\nthe body after exercise is increased more with power \\ncircuits than with a traditional weightlifting program. \\nWith power circuits the lifter does about 30 total reps \\nfor each body part with a weight that is about 75 to 85 \\npercent of the one-rep max (or a weight that could be \\nlifted for 8 to 10 reps). With power circuits it is wise to \\nuse either a training partner who can watch the clock \\nor a watch to monitor exercise time. Each exercise \\nin the circuit is performed for 15 seconds. The goal \\nis to complete as many reps as possible in those \\n15 seconds before moving on to the next exercise \\nwithout resting. When a total of 30 reps have been \\ncompleted for an exercise, the exercise is eliminated \\nfrom the circuit and a 15-second rest period is set in \\nits place on the following circuit rounds. For example, \\nif you complete 17 reps on the first pass through the \\ncircuit and 13 the second time through, on your third \\ntrip through the circuit, instead of doing more calf \\nraises, you would stop and rest for that 15 seconds \\nbefore moving on to the next exercise.\\nThe order of exercises in the circuit will affect \\nthe level of muscle fatigue that is reached during \\nthe power circuit. It is wise to alternate upper- and \\nlower-body exercises to allow the muscles to recover \\nand delay fatigue when doing power circuits, such \\nas in table 6.30. Whenever possible, push and \\npull exercises should be alternated as well. For \\ninstance, if the power circuit starts with a pulling \\nexercise such as pull-downs and then moves to a \\nlower-body exercise such as the leg press for the \\nquads, the next upper-body exercise should then be \\na pushing exercise such as the bench press, and \\nthe next lower-body exercise could be a leg curl for \\nthe hamstrings. Ideally, the power circuit should be \\ncompleted in less than 25 minutes.

All such methods can \\nbe effective means of increasing your muscle size.\\nPreexhaust Training\\nThis training method involves performing an isolation \\nexercise before a multijoint exercise for that same \\nmuscle group. The point is to fatigue the muscle \\nbeing trained with the isolation exercise so that it \\nbecomes the weak link in the multijoint exercise. For \\ninstance, an isolated muscle group such as the del-\\ntoids is fatigued (or preexhausted) with a single-joint \\nexercise, such as the dumbbell lateral raise, before \\ntraining it with a heavier, compound movement such \\nas the dumbbell shoulder press. The reason for this \\nis that the compound exercise involves the targeted \\nmuscle as well as at least one assistance muscle. \\nDuring the shoulder press, the deltoids are assisted \\nby the triceps. While this helps to lift more weight \\non the compound exercise, it can limit the muscle \\nfatigue the targeted muscle receives. This is espe-\\ncially true if the assistance muscle is much weaker \\nthan the targeted muscle. If this is true, then often \\nthe exercise ends when the assistance muscle, not \\nthe targeted muscle, has fatigued.\\nPreexhaust works to fatigue the primary muscle \\ngroup via the isolation exercise so that it can be \\nfurther fatigued on the compound exercise that \\nfollows. Of course, the strength of the targeted \\nmuscle will be compromised on the second exer-\\ncise. This prevents most bodybuilders from using \\nthe preexhaust method regularly, yet some use it \\nspecifically to limit the amount of weight they can \\nuse on the compound exercise. If a bodybuilder \\nhas an injury that is aggravated by a specific \\ncompound move, preexhaust training will limit the \\namount of weight he or she can use on the set \\nand thus limit the overall stress placed on the \\ninjured muscle or joint. Preexhaust can be followed \\nfor four to six weeks or done for each body part \\nonce every four to six workouts. See table 6.31 \\nfor good exercise choices to pair up for preexhaust \\ntraining. For a routine, do three sets of 10 to 15 \\nreps on the first exercise and three sets of 6 to \\n10 reps on the second. Or to use this system as \\na compound set, do one set of 10 to 15 reps on \\nthe first exercise and immediately follow with one \\nset of 6 to 10 reps on the second one. Rest about \\ntwo to three minutes and repeat this process twice. \\nRegardless of which method you choose, follow the \\npreexhaust pairs with one other exercise for that \\nmuscle group done in straight-set fashion.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 6.31 Sample Preexhaust Exercise \\nPairs\\nMuscle \\ngroup\\nIsolation \\nexercise Multijoint exercise\\nChest Pec deck Bench press\\nIncline fly Incline bench press \\nCable \\ncrossover \\nDecline bench press \\nShoulders Dumbbell \\nlateral raise\\nDumbbell shoulder \\npress\\nFront raise Barbell shoulder press \\nBack Straight-arm \\npulldown\\nPull-down, pull-up, \\nbarbell row\\nTriceps Triceps \\npressdown\\nTriceps dip\\nOverhead \\nextension \\nClose-grip bench press\\nBiceps Preacher curl Close-grip chin-up\\nLegs Leg extension Leg press\\nLeg curl Squat'),\n",

The variations of that exercise are \\nordered from hardest to easiest. An example of this \\ncan be explained using the dumbbell bench press. \\nThe hardest version of the dumbbell bench press is \\non an incline bench set between 30 and 45 degrees. \\nDoing a dumbbell bench press on a flat bench is \\neasier than doing an incline dumbbell bench press \\nbut harder than doing a decline dumbbell bench \\npress. Thus, an example of extended-set training \\nusing the dumbbell bench press would be to do \\none set of incline dumbbell bench press followed \\nimmediately by one set of dumbbell bench press on \\na flat bench using the same amount of weight and \\nfinishing with one set of decline dumbbell bench \\npress with the same weight. Because the rest time \\nis minimal between each bench adjustment, these \\nthree exercises can be considered one extended set.\\nEach adjustment with extended-set training \\nplaces the body in a position that is stronger than \\nthe previous position. This makes the weight easier \\nto lift on each successive position change, allowing \\nyou to continue doing more reps, when normally \\nyou would have failed if your body position had not \\nchanged. Not only does this allow you to train with \\nmore intensity, but the change in body position also \\nincreases the number of muscle fibers targeted in \\neach specific muscle group.\\nTo follow extended-set training, first choose a \\nweight that normally limits you to four or five reps on \\nthe first exercise (even though you will attempt no \\nmore than four reps). For each change in exercise \\nmovement for that extended set, you will attempt \\ntwo to four reps. Do not do more than four reps on \\nany exercise except on the final movement of the \\nextended set. You can work to failure on the last \\nexercise of all extended sets. If you have three or \\nfour exercise changes per extended set, you will have \\na total of about 7 to 16 reps. So in essence, you are \\nusing a weight on each movement that is best for \\nstrength gains, but at the end of the extended set \\nthe total reps that the muscle group has performed \\nfall in the range that is optimal for muscle growth.\\nThe first exercise movement should be the exer-\\ncise that your body is weakest at compared to all \\nother exercises in the extended set. Each succes-\\nsive exercise movement in the extended set should \\nbe one that your body is stronger at compared to \\nthe previous exercise yet weaker than the one \\nthat follows. Rest time between sets will always \\nbe minimal but can be varied depending on the \\nbiomechanical advantage gained in the proceeding \\nset. Some exercises will be dramatically easier than \\nthe previous one; for these, rest should involve \\nchanging only your body position. Some exercises \\nprovide a minimal biomechanical advantage; for \\nthese you may rest up to 15 seconds before per-\\nforming. Rest between extended sets for three to \\nfour minutes. Perform between one and three sets \\nfor each extended set, depending on the number of \\nexercise movements used in the extended set and \\nthe number of years training experience you have.\\nThis is an extremely advanced training technique \\nbecause it involves heavy weight with very little \\nrest. These two training techniques are usually at \\nopposition to one another, meaning you either train \\nheavy or fast, but rarely ever both—until now.\\nFor most bodybuilders, doing one extended set \\nwill suffice. This will depend on the amount of exer-\\ncise movements you include in each extended set \\nas well as your training experience. Some extended \\nsets involve as few as two different movements \\n(such as with shrugs), while some include as many \\nas nine (such as with the ultimate biceps extended \\nset). See examples of extended sets in table 6.32. \\nThe more exercise movements per extended set, \\nthe fewer total extended sets you will need. Most \\nlifters will need about two or three extended sets for \\nthe trap workout, while many will struggle to finish \\none ultimate biceps extended set.\\nYou can incorporate extended sets into your train-\\ning in a number of ways. You can do one extended \\nset per muscle group along with other straight sets \\nfor that muscle group. You can do one giant extended \\nset per muscle group. Or you can choose two differ-\\nent extended sets for each muscle group—as long \\nas they complement each other and do not mimic \\nexercise movements. Follow extended-set training \\nfor about 4 to 6 weeks, and follow it with a training \\nprogram that incorporates standard sets and higher \\nreps such as the finish pump method or triangle \\ntraining method. Do not return to extended-set train-\\ning for at least 12 weeks. There are several reasons \\nfor this. The first is the intensity factor, as described \\npreviously. The other problem is exercise order. With \\nthis style of training, many of the basic movements \\nare trained toward the end of the extended set. This \\nis the reverse order of a typical bodybuilding workout.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nExtended-Set Training'),\n",

It uses multiple variations of a single exer-\\ncise to ensure that all muscle fibers in a muscle \\nare adequately trained.\\nTo understand the concept of exercise angles, \\nyou need to know the basic structure of muscle. \\nOne important but surprising fact is that individ -\\nual muscle fibers rarely run the entire length of \\nthe muscle. Muscles are actually composed of a \\nsequence of one- to four-inch (two-and-a-half- to \\nten-centimeter) segments of muscle fiber linked \\ntogether. For that reason, you can’t think of muscle \\nfibers as being synonymous with the actual muscle. \\nThis is critical, as the growth of each muscle fiber \\ndepends on whether it is actually stimulated during \\na particular exercise. In many cases, muscle fibers \\nremain unused and just go along for the ride during a \\nlifting movement. Whether the fiber is used depends \\nnot only on the amount of resistance but also on \\nthe angle of the exercise and the specific range of \\nmotion used in the exercise. If the angle (such as \\nin the flat bench press versus incline bench press) \\nand the range of motion (such as partial movements \\nversus full range of motion) do not call a specific \\nmuscle fiber into action, no growth will occur in \\nthat fiber. To make sure you hit each muscle fiber \\nand stimulate it to grow, you have to use a variety \\nof exercises. And even for a given exercise, you \\nmust use variety. For example, on dumbbell bench \\npresses, you can adjust the angle of the bench from'),\n",

In addition, because there are \\ncrossover effects from training a muscle on one \\nside of the body, one-sided training can encour -\\nage better muscle growth on the untrained side. \\nThat is, the resting side also receives nervous \\nstimulation from the increased blood flow that is \\ncaused by exercising the muscles on the other \\nside of the body. This enhances the delivery of \\noxygen, nutrients, and hormones to the resting \\nmuscles while helping to flush away waste prod-\\nucts from the previous workouts. The result may \\nbe better muscle regeneration and growth of the \\nmuscles.\\nAnother benefit of one-sided training is that \\nit trains the core muscles (the visible and deep \\nmuscles of the abdomen and low back) that are \\nimportant for a better overall strength base. \\nPerhaps the best point about one-sided training, \\nhowever, is the pure novelty of the stimulus that \\nit places on the body. It stimulates the nervous \\nsystem and muscle fibers in a more unique way \\nthan any other training programs. New stimuli \\nmay lead to gains in muscle mass and muscle \\nstrength.\\nOne-sided training breaks up workouts into right-\\nside and left-side training days. In other words, \\nmuscles on the left side of the body (such as \\nbiceps and triceps) are trained on one day, and \\nthe same muscles on the right side of the body \\nare trained on a different day. The program (shown \\nin table 6.35) consists of four workouts per week \\nthat train the entire body once. Workout 1 consists \\nof the right chest, shoulder, traps, triceps, back, \\nand biceps. Workout 2 consists of the left chest, \\nshoulder, traps, triceps, back, and biceps. On work-\\nout 3 you would hit the right quad, hams, glutes, \\nand calves. Workout 4 closes out the body with the \\nleft quad, hams, glutes, and calves. Abs can be \\ntrained at the end of the first and fourth workout.\\nThe volume of work performed per muscle group \\nis fairly low (two exercises per muscle group for \\ntwo or three sets per exercise) because this type \\nof training is somewhat shocking on the nervous \\nsystem. The weight used should be light enough \\nto allow for 10 to 12 reps per set. Follow the one-\\nsided training for only two to four weeks before \\nswitching back to normal bilateral training, and do \\nnot revisit this alternative training style more than \\nonce every four to six months.\\nIn addition to the exercises given in the sample \\nworkouts, there are many other unilateral exercises \\nyou can perform for each muscle group.

Doing \\nthese exercises twice allows you to milk that exer-\\ncise for all the benefits it offers. And those benefits \\ninclude increased size, strength, and fat loss.\\nBy doing these exercises at the beginning and \\nend of the workout, you maximize muscle growth \\nand strength. That’s because you do the exercise \\nfirst when you are freshest and strongest, which \\nmaximizes your strength and the mechanical over-\\nload you place on the muscles. When you do the \\nexercise at the start of the workout you will use \\nheavy weights and lower reps (6-8 per set). This rep \\nrange is best for building strength and mass due \\nto the heavier load it places on the muscles, which \\nmaximizes muscle damage, and therefore strength \\ngains and growth. When you damage muscle fibers, \\nthey are replaced with new ones that grow bigger \\nand stronger in an effort to adapt to the overload \\nplaced on them. But that’s just one way that muscles \\ngrow. Using this rep range also better stimulates the \\nproduction of the anabolic hormone testosterone.\\nWhen you work that same exercise at the very end \\nof the workout, you are preexhausted by the exer-\\ncises that preceded it. This maximizes the fatigue \\nthat you place on the muscles, as does the rep range \\nyou will use at these points. You’ll do three sets at \\nthe end of the workout. Set 1 uses the same weight \\nthat you started with. This is to further enhance the \\nmuscle damage you started at the beginning of the \\nworkout by forcing the muscles to move that weight \\nwhen they are already fatigued. You’ll be able to \\nget only a few reps because of this, but every one \\nof these reps will push muscle damage that much \\nfurther. You finish with two sets of 12 to 15 reps. \\nThis higher rep range will take your muscles to the \\nlimits of fatigue, not to mention the fact that you \\nkeep the rest between sets in these three final \\nsets to one minute to really fatigue the muscles. \\nFatigue is also critical for muscle growth due to the \\nbiochemical waste products in the muscle cells from \\nthe burning of glucose and fat for the energy needed \\nfor the muscles to contract. This signals an increase \\nin anabolic hormones and growth factors like growth \\nhormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-\\nI). The anabolic factors, along with testosterone, \\ninfluence muscle growth by enhancing the growth of \\nthe new muscle fibers that will replace the damaged \\nones and by enhancing muscle protein synthesis. \\nMuscle protein synthesis works to build up all of the \\nmuscle fibers by providing them with more protein. \\nSince muscle fibers are made of protein, more pro-\\ntein means bigger muscle fibers.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 6.37 Bookend Workouts\\nWORKOUT 1: CHEST, BICEPS, ABS\\nMuscle group Exercise Sets/reps Rest\\nChest Bench press 3/6-8 2-3 min\\nIncline dumbbell bench press 3/8-10 2 min\\nIncline dumbbell fly 3/10-12 1-2 min\\nCable crossover 2/12-15 1-2 min\\nBench press 1/to failure\\n1\\n2/12-15\\n1 min\\n1 min\\nBiceps Barbell curl 3/6-8 2-3 min\\nIncline dumbbell curl 3/8-10 2 min\\nCable concentration curl 3/10-12 1 min\\nBarbell curl 1/to failure\\n1\\n2/12-15\\n1 min\\n1 min\\nAbs Hanging leg raise\\n2 2/6-8 1-2 min\\nCrunch 3/to failure 1 min\\nHanging leg raise 1/to failure\\n2/to failure1,3\\n1 min\\n1 min'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength120\\nThe push–pull training split (covered in chapter 8) \\nis one of the simplest and most effective splits \\never devised. Having been used by competitive \\nbodybuilders and other high-performance athletes, \\nthe concept involves categorizing all weight-train-\\ning exercises down to one of two types—pushing \\nmovements and pulling movements—and split -\\nting up workouts accordingly. A typical push day \\nincludes exercises for the chest, shoulders, quads, \\nand triceps because these are considered the \\npushing muscles. And a typical pull day trains the \\nback, biceps, hamstrings, and traps. But weight \\ntraining is not quite that simple.\\nFor most muscle groups, you can do at least \\na few exercises that don’t fall under the strict \\ndefinition of either a push exercise or a pull exer-\\ncise. For example, leg extension, leg curl, biceps \\ncurl, triceps extension, lateral raise, and fly are \\nall exercises that are technically neither pushing \\nnor pulling movements. They are actually what we \\nwould consider \\nangular movements. That is, the \\nmovement doesn’t follow a straight line but rather \\nthe path of an arc. These are always isolation exer-\\ncises because they involve only a single joint. Push-\\ning or pulling a weight in a straight line involves \\nmultiple joints working together. Thus, push and \\npull exercises are always multijoint exercises.\\nThe push–pull training split works well for power-\\nlifters and strength athletes who rarely do angular \\n(isolation) exercises. But because bodybuilding \\nrelies heavily on such movements, I created the \\npush–pull training split into the push–pull–angle \\nsplit. In it, you’ll have one push day in which you \\nhit chest, legs, shoulders, triceps, and calves with \\nmultijoint exercises; one pull day in which you \\nhit back, traps, and biceps, again with multijoint \\nmoves, as well as abs; and two angle days, which \\ncollectively hit all major muscle groups with isola-\\ntion exercises only.\\nOne angle day trains the chest, legs, shoulders, \\nand triceps, while the other trains back, biceps, \\nforearms, and abs. You’ll end up training each \\nmuscle group twice per week, once with compound \\nmoves (push or pull) and again with isolation \\nmoves (angle). This way, you can focus on one \\nheavy basic training day for each muscle group \\nwhere you use lower reps, and one lighter isolation \\nday where you use higher reps, for a multifaceted \\napproach to overall growth, muscle mass, and \\nstrength. Not only is each muscle being trained \\nmore frequently, but each is getting different types \\nof stress (heavy and light) each week. Separating \\nthe types of exercises into two workouts for each \\nbody part will be a welcome change for your mus-\\ncles, resulting in greater hypertrophy and strength \\ngains.\\nFollow the four-day push–pull–angle training split \\nas suggested in table 6.38 for four weeks. Feel \\nfree to use it longer, but after four weeks on this \\nsample program be sure to make some changes, \\nsuch as swapping out the exercises listed in table \\n6.39 in the Push–Pull–Angle Exercises box for \\nothers listed as follows. Also, feel free to alter \\nrep ranges and rest periods, depending on your \\ntraining goals. The routine listed in table 6.38 is \\na combination of strength and hypertrophy, using \\nlow- (4-7), moderate- (8-12), and high-rep schemes \\n(15-20).\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nPush–Pull–Angle Training'),\n",

Using the bench press as an \\nexample, that means as you press the bar off your \\nchest the resistance gets progressively heavier the \\nfarther you press the bar to full arm extension. That \\nincrease in resistance necessitates the application \\nof more force toward the top of the lift, which limits \\nthe slowing at the top of an exercise that normally \\noccurs to stop the weight.\\nBands are also great to travel with because they \\nweigh little yet provide ample resistance.

This time period allows the pro -\\ncesses of muscle recovery to kick in so that the \\nmuscle damage inflicted in the previous workout \\ncan be repaired and the depleted fuel stores \\ncan be replenished. However, on occasion, going \\nagainst conventional thinking on recovery can be \\nan advantage for making muscle gains. This can \\nbe done by training similar muscle groups on con-\\nsecutive days or even training them twice in one \\nday. Increasing the frequency of training for short \\nperiods can lead to more frequent muscle growth.\\nBack-to-Back Training\\nBack-to-back training refers to training a muscle \\ngroup on two consecutive days. It is also referred \\nto in some bodybuilding circles as feeder work -\\nouts, because the concept is to train the muscle \\ngroup again the very next day but with very \\nlight weight, higher reps, fewer sets, and very \\nlow intensity to help increase blood flow to the \\nmuscle tissue. The theory is that this will supply \\nthe recovering muscle cells with more nutrients \\nsuch as amino acids and glucose (both critical for \\nmuscle growth and strength), anabolic hormones \\nsuch as GH and testosterone, and more oxygen \\nfor faster recovery. It will also help remove the \\nwaste products and cellular debris that were cre-\\nated from the previous workout. It also leads to \\ngreater water flow from the blood supply into the \\nmuscle—this is the cause of the pump—which \\nis believed to turn on muscle-building pathways \\nbecause of the stretch that is placed on the \\nmuscle cell by the volume overload. While no \\nstudies have looked at this effect on muscle \\ngrowth directly, one study found that the cortisol \\nresponse on the second workout day is signifi -\\ncantly lower and the testosterone levels are \\nslightly higher (Pullinen et al. 2002). Hormonal \\nresponses to a resistance exercise performed \\nunder the influence of delayed-onset muscle \\nsoreness. This means that a greater anabolic \\nenvironment is created within the muscles, which \\ncan enhance the potential for muscle growth and \\nstrength gains.\\nThe first back-to-back workout for each muscle \\ngroup should be very intense. Muscle failure \\nshould be reached on all sets and followed with \\nforced reps or drop sets. Volume should also be \\nhigh (12 to 16 sets per muscle group) to ensure \\nthe muscle is thoroughly fatigued. The second \\nworkout should be lower in both intensity and \\nvolume. Perform only about six to eight sets per \\nmuscle group and perform 15 to 20 reps, never \\nreaching muscle failure. See table 6.42 for a \\nsample back-to-back workout program.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 6.42 Back-to-Back Back Attack\\nWorkouts 1 and 2 are performed on two consecutive \\ndays.\\nExercise Sets Reps\\nWORKOUT 1\\nPull-up 3 6-10*\\nBarbell row 4 6-10**\\nSeated cable row 4 6-10**\\nPulldown (underhand grip) 4 6-10**\\nWORKOUT 2\\nPulldown (wide grip) 2 15-20\\nBarbell row 2 15-20\\nSeated cable row 1 15-20\\nPulldown (underhand grip) 1 15-20\\n*Perform two or three forced reps at the end of each set.\\n**Perform each set to failure.

The program is based on research \\nthat shows that when muscles are trained twice \\nin the same day, the amount of muscle glycogen \\nincreases by nearly double the normal value. Since \\nglycogen pulls water into muscle cells, the muscle \\ncells become fuller (more pumped). This causes \\na stretch on the muscle cells that is believed to \\ntrigger muscle growth.\\nTwice-a-day training also encourages capillary \\ngrowth in muscle tissue and increases the density \\nof fuel-metabolizing mitochondria in the muscle \\ncells, both of which help the muscle to assimilate \\nnutrients. It also works to boost resting metabolism \\nafter the twice-a-day workouts, which can help to \\nencourage fat loss during cutting phases of training.\\nWith twice-a-day training the same exercises \\nshould be done for both workouts. This is because \\ndifferent exercises stress different muscle fibers, \\nand it is essential to stress the same muscle \\nfibers in the second workout as were stressed in \\nthe first. However, the order of these exercises is \\nnot critical. So some bodybuilders begin the first \\nworkout with compound movement and then finish \\nwith isolation exercises. In the second workout \\nthey reverse that order. This helps to prevent \\nboredom. Repetitions for both workouts should \\nbe high (in the range of 12 to 20) to prevent over-\\nstressing the targeted muscle group and better \\ndeplete muscle glycogen. Rest should be no more \\nthan 60 seconds between sets to best deplete \\nglycogen stores, increase caloric expenditure, and \\nfacilitate fat loss.\\nWorkouts should be separated by at least three \\nbut no more than eight hours of rest. If there is not \\nenough time between sessions, the testosterone \\nresponse that occurs from training may be blunted, \\nand cortisol levels may increase too much. Muscles \\nshould receive about three to seven days of recov-\\nery before you train them again. Use the twice-a-\\nday program for no more than six weeks, because \\nusing it any longer may actually hinder progress. \\nSee table 6.43 for sample twice-a-day workouts.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTwice-a-Day Training\\nExercise Sets Reps\\nBACK WORKOUT 1\\nBarbell row 3 12-15\\nWide-grip pulldown 3 12-15\\nStraight-arm pulldown 3 15\\nBACK WORKOUT 2\\nStraight-arm pulldown 3 15 \\nWide-grip pulldown 3 12-15\\nBarbell row 3 12-15\\nLEG WORKOUT 1\\nSquat 3 15-20\\nLeg press 3 15-20\\nLeg extension 3 15-20\\nLying leg curl 3 15-20\\nStanding calf raise 3 20\\nSeated calf raise 3 20\\n> continued\\nTABLE 6.43 Twice the Workout\\nExercise Sets Reps\\nCHEST WORKOUT 1\\nIncline barbell press 3 12-15\\nDumbbell bench press 3 12-15\\nIncline dumbbell fly 3 15\\nCHEST WORKOUT 2\\nIncline dumbbell fly 3 15\\nDumbbell bench press 3 12-15\\nIncline barbell press 3 12-15\\nSHOULDER WORKOUT 1\\nDumbbell shoulder press 3 12-15\\nWide-grip upright row 3 12-15\\nDumbbell lateral raise 3 15\\nSHOULDER WORKOUT 2\\nDumbbell lateral raise 3 15 \\nWide-grip upright row 3 12-15\\nDumbbell shoulder press 3 12-15'),\n",

Whether you’re a beginner, \\nintermediate, or advanced weightlifter and just \\nwant to add general muscle mass to your frame, or \\nyou want to shed body fat while adding muscle, or \\nyou have specific muscle groups you want to focus \\non building up, this chapter has a program for you.\\nMASS-BUILDING PROGRAMS\\nAlthough it is well established that certain exercise \\nchoices, orders of exercises, volumes, resistances, \\nand amounts of rest between sets are better than \\nothers for developing muscle mass, sticking within \\nthose guidelines for too long can actually hinder \\nyour progress. This is the foundation of periodiza-\\ntion (covered in chapter 3). For instance, although \\nthe repetition maximum continuum indicates that \\nusing a range of 6 to 12 reps per set is best for \\nmuscle hypertrophy, sticking within those confines \\nwill lead to stagnation in muscle growth. There -\\nfore, while some of your training should be done \\nwith this rep range, you also need to work in both \\nlower- and higher-rep ranges. The question, then, \\nis how and when to do this. This rationale also \\napplies to the other acute variables of training. To \\nensure that gains in muscle mass are optimized \\nand persistent, smart bodybuilders realize that the \\nfrequent cycling of their workouts is as essential \\nto their progress as the acute variables.\\nDeveloping a basic cycle that carries your training \\nover the next 6 months or year is much like an insur-\\nance policy that protects your progress. This template \\nwill serve as a basic guide to steer you through your \\njourney to gain more muscle. If you are a beginner, \\nyou should follow this program as prescribed for \\nyour first 6 months of serious training. The interme-\\ndiate (6 to 12 months of training experience) and \\nadvanced (over a year of consistent training exper-\\nience) weightlifters are provided a yearlong training \\nguide. However, at this level you can take a few side \\nroads here or there as long as you mind the overall \\nscheme of the program. In the end, remember that \\neverything works, but nothing works forever.\\nBeginner Program (First Six Months)\\nThis six-month program breaks down into six four-\\nweek segments (see table 7.1). In the first three \\nsegments, you follow a whole-body training split \\nand train with weights three days per week, working \\nyour entire body each time. The first four weeks \\nyou will train one exercise per muscle group. The \\nexercises are the same for each workout and the \\nreps are 15 per set with two- to three-minute rest \\nperiods between sets. This helps to train the ner-\\nvous system during this introductory phase. The \\nsecond four-week cycle adds a second exercise to \\neach muscle group to increase both volume and \\nvariety in the way the muscles are trained. Exer -\\ncises performed are the same for each workout and \\nreps are 12 to 15 per set with two- to three-minute \\nrest periods.

The exercises per muscle group drop \\nback to just one per workout but increase in number \\nof sets. Reps drop down to 10 to 12, while rest \\nperiods remain the same at two to three minutes \\nbetween sets.\\nIn the last three segments, you’ll train with a \\ntwo-day training split for a total of four workouts per \\nweek. During the first four weeks exercises will be \\nthe same for each muscle group on the two work-\\nouts that are done each week. Most major muscle \\ngroups will be trained with three exercises for a \\ntotal of six sets per muscle group. The exceptions \\nare legs, which will be trained with four exercises, \\nand the smaller muscle groups like biceps and \\ntriceps are trained with only two exercises per work-\\nout. During the second four-week cycle, exercises \\ndrop back to about two per major muscle group, \\nbut the sets increase to three per exercise. Rest \\nperiod during this entire phase drops down to one \\nto two minutes between sets. Each muscle group \\nis trained with different exercises on the different \\nworkout days. During the last four-week cycle the \\nexercises increase to about three for most major \\nmuscle groups, as do the sets for most (three per \\nexercise). After this phase is completed, you can \\ngraduate to the intermediate program.\\nIntermediate Program  \\n(Six Months to One Year)\\nIf you are an intermediate lifter, you are at a \\nunique level of weightlifting experience. Because \\nof neurological training, you have surpassed the \\nrapid gains in strength that beginners experience, \\nyet you haven’t started to plateau in the gains \\nrelated to muscle fiber growth. You also have \\na fair amount of knowledge of and enthusiasm \\nfor strength training. This is the stage where the \\nparticular training program is not as critical for \\nmaking continued gains as long as you maintain \\na periodized plan.\\nIf you are an intermediate lifter, you should \\nfollow a basic training program that involves a \\nthree-day or four-day split, as discussed in chapter \\n5. Making frequent changes in exercise selection \\nprovides the muscles with resistance from a vari-\\nety of angles to stress different individual muscle \\nfibers within the targeted muscle. However, the \\nmost critical change comes in the form of the \\nresistance, or weight, used and the number of reps \\nperformed per set.\\nThe yearlong program found in table 7.2 outlines \\nthe rep ranges you should follow throughout the \\nyear to graduate to advanced weightlifter status. \\nBecause research shows that periodized programs \\nthat last a minimum of 8 weeks and a maximum \\nof 20 weeks are the most beneficial (Rhea and \\nAlderman 2004), the intermediate program follows \\na 20-week linear mass cycle, then an 8-week mass \\nmicrocycle, and finally a 20-week undulating-mass \\ncycle (which assumes you are using a four-day \\nsplit). Each phase of the program allows one week \\nof active recovery (where other physical activity out-\\nside of weightlifting is encouraged) before moving \\nto the next phase, along with one week of active \\nrest during the undulating phase, for a 52-week \\nprogram that will keep the muscle gains coming. \\nBut feel free to skip these active rest weeks if you \\nprefer to march straight through.\\nTABLE 7.2 Advancing Intermediate Program\\nPHASE 1: LINEAR MASS\\nWeek Rep range \\n1-4 4-6\\n5-8 6-8\\n9-12 8-10\\n13-16 10-12\\n17-20 12-15\\n21 Active rest\\nPHASE 2: MICROMASS\\nWeek Rep range \\n22 8-10\\n23 5-8\\n24 3-5\\n25 12-15\\n26 3-5\\n27 5-8\\n28 8-10\\n29 10-12\\n30 Active rest'),\n",

For example, try slow-rep training \\nduring weeks 5 to 8, negative training during week \\n23, and barbell blasting during week 26; throw in \\nsuperset and forced-rep training where desired \\nduring weeks 31 to 51.\\nAdvanced Program  \\n(More Than One Year)\\nIf you are an advanced weightlifter, you are at \\nthe most difficult level of weightlifting in which to \\nencourage muscle growth. This is because you \\nhave spent a long time training and therefore are \\ncloser to reaching your genetic ceiling for muscle \\ngrowth. Because of this, you must frequently train \\nwith advanced training techniques that are high \\nin intensity to help stimulate muscle growth. The \\none-year advanced program in table 7.3 cycles \\nadvanced training techniques found in chapter 6 \\nwith basic training splits to offer periods of lower \\nintensity in which the muscles can recover before \\nthe next advanced technique starts. Feel free to \\nreplace any technique with one that better suits \\nyour needs at the time. The same can be said \\nabout the training splits. Neither the specific \\ntechniques nor the specific splits are critical to \\nthis yearlong program. What is important is that \\nyou cycle four to six weeks of advanced technique \\ntraining with about four to six weeks of a basic \\ntraining program that is lower in intensity.\\nIf you are an intermediate and are interested \\nin making gains in general mass, you should \\nfollow the basic design guidelines in chapter 5 for \\nmaking exercise selections. Rest periods should \\nbe about two to three minutes between exercises, \\nbut you should manipulate these on occasion. For \\nexample, when reps are in a low phase (4 to 6), \\nallow up to four minutes of rest between sets. \\nWhen reps are in a high phase (more than 12), \\nlimit rest to one minute between sets. For all other \\nrep ranges, keep the rest period between sets to \\ntwo to three minutes. Cycling the rest periods will \\nfurther enhance gains in muscle mass.\\nIf you are concerned with gaining muscle while \\nlosing body fat, you should limit rest periods to one \\nminute or less. Research suggests that keeping \\nthe rest periods below one minute can enhance \\nthe number of calories burned during and after a \\nstrength training workout, regardless of the rep \\nrange used (Falvo et al. 2005). It is also wise to \\nuse as many compound exercises as possible. \\nThese use more muscle groups than isolation exer-\\ncises and therefore help to burn more calories. Of \\ncourse, performing aerobic exercise in addition to \\nstrength training is critical to losing body fat along \\nwith limiting caloric intake through proper dieting. \\nFor more on maximizing fat burning while building \\nmuscle and gaining strength, see part IV .\\nAs an intermediate, if you want to use more \\nadvanced training techniques during this program, \\nyou can find numerous methods in chapter 6 that \\nyou can throw in where the rep ranges are appropri-\\nate.

Maybe they want to maximize \\nboth mass and strength, maybe they want to get \\nlean and large, or maybe they want to develop a \\nspecific muscle group. If you are an intermediate or \\nadvanced weightlifter and are interested in specific \\ngoals, you should follow a long-term program that \\nmanipulates the appropriate training variables to \\nenable you to reach those goals. This portion of \\nthe chapter has detailed program cycles to match \\ncommon goals shared by most bodybuilders. More \\nthan likely, any goal regarding strength training \\nfor muscle mass will be listed here. Try one of \\nthe following programs that meets your goals, or \\ndesign your own personalized program based on \\nthe knowledge you have acquired through reading \\nthis book.\\nLean and Large\\nChances are that if you are interested in bodybuild-\\ning or strength training for muscle mass, you are \\nalso interested in building just lean muscle mass \\nand not adding body fat. Body fat blurs the shape \\nand striations of well-developed muscles.\\nAlthough a proper diet and plenty of aerobic \\nexercise are tools to help you shed body fat while \\ngaining muscle, certain strength training programs \\nare better than others for getting lean. This Lean \\nand Large program is composed of three four-week \\nphases that all emphasize compound movements \\n(see table 7.4). Compound exercises use the most \\nmuscle fibers and therefore burn the most calories.'),\n",

That’s why this program uses heavy \\nweight for half the sets and light weight for the \\nfinal sets of most exercises. Rest between sets \\nis also critical for burning calories; shorter rest \\nperiods lead to greater calorie burn. This program \\nuses rest periods of 30 to 60 seconds between \\nsets and a four-day training split. However, you \\nwill be training six days a week to maximize your \\ncaloric expenditure. This means you can repeat \\nthe four-day split (done on consecutive days), with \\none rest day between workout 4 and workout 1, a \\ntotal of six times. For example, you will start with \\nworkout 1 on Monday, workout 2 on Tuesday, work-\\nout 3 on Wednesday, and workout 4 on Thursday. \\nYou rest on Friday and then continue the cycle with \\nworkout 1 on Saturday.\\nIn phase 1, you train with 6 reps on the heavy \\nsets and 12 reps on the light sets. You do two \\nheavy sets and two light sets for most exercises. \\nRest periods during this first phase are 60 seconds \\nbetween sets.\\nIn phase 2, the reps on the heavy sets drop \\nto 5 per set while reps on the light sets increase \\nto 15 per set. Lighter sets also increase to three \\nper exercise to increase volume and total calories \\nburned during the workout. Rest periods should \\ndrop to 30 seconds between sets to further \\nenhance calorie burn during and after the workout.\\nIn phase 3, the reps on the heavy sets drop \\nagain to 4 per set, and reps on the light sets \\nincrease to 20 per set. In this phase, heavy sets \\nincrease to three. Rest periods should remain at \\n30 seconds between sets.\\nAt the end of phase 3 you can continue the \\n12-week program if you feel you have more body \\nfat to lose. Take one week off from the gym with an \\nactive rest period, in which you do other activities \\na minimum of six days per week. Then simply start \\nthe program over at phase 1.\\nBig and Strong\\nFor some weightlifters getting big is not the only \\ngoal. They are concerned with developing strength \\nand muscle mass at the same time—and with \\ngood reason. Generally, as muscles increase in \\nstrength, they also increase in size. While there \\nisn’t a definite correlation between muscle strength \\nand muscle size, it makes sense that if you can \\nlift more weight or perform more reps with a given \\namount of weight, you will better stimulate muscle \\ngrowth. This follows the principle of overload.\\nThe six-month Big and Strong program cycles \\ntwo pyramid techniques—the DeLorme ascending \\npyramid method (covered in chapter 9) and the \\nOxford descending pyramid method (covered in \\nchapter 6). (See table 7.5.) With the DeLorme \\nascending pyramid technique your first set is done \\nwith about 50 percent of your 10-rep max (10RM) \\nfor a given exercise, but for just 10 reps. On the \\nsecond set, you increase the weight to about 75 \\npercent of your 10RM for that exercise and again \\nstop at 10 reps. On the third set you increase \\nthe weight to 100 percent of your 10RM for that \\nexercise and complete as many reps as you can \\nuntil reaching failure. The repetition maximum is \\nnot critical, because many powerlifters use this \\npyramid method with 3RM, 4RM, 5RM, and 6RM \\nto train for strength. In fact, during the second \\nhalf of this program you will use a 6RM during \\nthe DeLorme portion of the training. With the \\nOxford descending pyramid technique, the first \\nset is done with 100 percent of your 10RM to \\nfailure. On the second and third sets you reduce \\nthe weight just enough to allow you to complete \\nabout 10 reps. Again, the repetition maximum you \\nuse is not critical because it is commonly used \\nwith 6RM, 8RM, 12RM, and 15RM. In the second \\nhalf of this program the reps increase to 12 per \\nset. See table 7.5.\\nThe DeLorme method tends to be better for \\nderiving strength gains, while the Oxford method \\nis better for stimulating muscle growth (Fish et al. \\n2003). This may be due to the amount of times you \\nreach failure on each exercise. With the DeLorme \\ntechnique, failure is reached only once, whereas \\nthe Oxford technique elicits failure on all three sets. \\nAustralian researchers have shown that training to \\nfailure on just one set increases strength gains \\nbetter than going to failure on more than one set \\n(Drinkwater et al. 2005). Muscle failure, however, \\nseems to be important for inducing muscle growth. \\nThe reason for this is that reaching muscle failure \\nbetter stimulates the release of growth hormone \\n(GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). Both \\nare anabolic hormones that stimulate muscles to \\ngrow. That is why this program cycles both meth-\\nods. In the end, you achieve greater strength and \\nmuscle growth.'),\n",

The difference in \\nthese two phases is the amount of weight you do \\non the last set of each exercise. During weeks 1 \\nto 6 you end with a weight you can do for 10 reps. \\nDuring weeks 13 to 18 you end with a weight that \\nyou can do for 6 reps. During these parts of the \\nprogram you will train each muscle group twice per \\nweek. That’s because you will need less recovery \\ntime between workouts because you do fewer total \\nworking sets per workout and train to failure on \\nonly one set per exercise.\\nYou can use the strength you gain during weeks \\n1 to 6 and 13 to 18 for lifting heavier weights \\nduring weeks 7 to 12 and 19 to 24. Weeks 7 to \\n12 and 9 to 24 take you down the pyramid as you \\ndecrease the weight on each successive set for \\nall exercises. During these phases, you train each \\nmuscle group just once per week because they \\nwill need the recovery since you will do more total \\nworking sets per muscle group, plus you will train \\nto failure on every set.\\nShortcut to Size  \\n(Micromuscle) Program\\nOne of my most popular training programs is the \\n12-week Shortcut to Size (a.k.a. Micromuscle) \\nthat is featured on bodybuilding.com and detailed \\nin table 7.6. More than a million people have \\ncompleted the program, and many have gained as \\nmuch as 20 pounds (about 9 kilograms) of lean \\nmuscle. The strength gains with this program are \\nalso phenomenal.\\nThe Shortcut to Size program is based on linear \\nperiodization using microcycles, as covered in \\nchapter 3. In week 1 your rep range will be 12 to \\n15. In week 2 you bump up all the weights and \\ndrop reps to 9 to 11. Week 3 adds weight again \\nto each exercise to drop the rep range to 6 to 8. \\nAnd in week 4 you bump the weight up again to \\ndrop reps to 3 to 5 per set. Those are the four \\nmicrocycles that you will repeat. On week 4 you \\nhave completed the first phase. On week 5 you \\ndrop the weight back down and start all over at \\n12 to 15 reps per set. This is the start of phase \\n2. But now you will be able to do each rep range \\nwith at least 5 and up to 20 pounds (a little less \\nthan 2.5 and as much as about 9 kilograms) more \\nthan you could in phase 1. In week 6 (week 2 of \\nphase 2), you will be back at 9 to 11 reps per set. \\nIn week 7, or week 3 of phase 2, weight will go up \\nagain to drop your reps down to 6 to 8 per set. \\nAnd in week 8 (or week 4 of phase 2), weight will \\nincrease for 3 to 5 reps per set. That completes \\nphase 2. And in week 9 you start the final phase \\n(phase 3) by dropping back down to 12 to 15 reps \\nper set and run through the four microcycles again \\nuntil you are back down at 3 to 5 reps per set. Of \\ncourse, in each phase you will be using 5 to 20 \\npounds more than you did in phase 2 and 10 to 40 \\npounds (4.5 to 18 kilograms) more than you used \\nin phase 1. This is how you get stronger—much \\nstronger—over this 12-week program.\\nThe constant increase in weight each week and \\nthe recycling of these four phases lead to impres-\\nsive gains in strength. The microcycles also lead to \\nmuscle hypertrophy due to the constant changing \\nof the rep ranges each week. Another reason for \\nthe gains in strength and mass has to do with the \\nfact that you keep the weight steady on each exer-\\ncise for all sets and you are forced to complete \\nthe minimum number of reps in that rep range.\\nGreater gains in strength and muscle mass are \\nguaranteed with this program. I have seen some \\nimpressive results with this program. In men, I \\nhave seen gains of strength over 90 pounds on the \\nsquat and over 50 pounds on the bench press. And \\nfor muscle, many guys have gained over 20 pounds \\nof muscle, as I mentioned. Yes, pure muscle, while \\nactually dropping body fat. Speaking of body fat, \\nwhen maximizing body fat with my training and diet \\ntweaks, some men have lost over 20 pounds of \\nbody fat. And women have also seen impressive \\ngains in strength and muscle while losing body \\nfat. Women following my program have increased \\ntheir squat strength by over 60 pounds and bench \\npress strength by 30 pounds. And they have seen \\ngains in muscle of over 10 pounds and fat loss \\nover 10 pounds.\\nThe first exercise you do for each muscle group \\n(except for abs and calves) will remain constant \\nthroughout all 12 weeks. This is the exercise where \\nyou focus on increasing your strength. Most of the \\nassistance exercises that follow the first exercise \\nwill change in every phase. For abs, the exercises \\nwill change each week based on the rep ranges. \\nThis is because some ab exercises are easier to \\ndo for higher reps, while some are difficult to do for \\nlower reps. So I organized the best ab exercises \\nfor the prescribed rep ranges.'),\n",

Yet, if you want to focus \\nmore on one of these three goals, you can also \\ndo that and still get the other benefits.\\nRest a good 3 minutes or even longer between \\nsets. The key is performing as many reps as pos-\\nsible within that prescribed rep range. More reps \\nequal more work performed each workout, and that \\nequates to greater strength gains over time. During \\nweeks 1 and 2 of each phase of the program, you \\nwill do one rest-pause set on the last set of each \\nexercise. To do this, reach muscle failure on the \\nlast set, then rack the weight and rest 15 seconds. \\nThen continue the set until you reach muscle fail-\\nure again. During weeks 3 and 4 of all phases you \\nwill do a drop set on the last set of each exercise. \\nTo do this, take the last set to muscle failure and \\nthen immediately reduce the weight by 20-30%, \\nand continue the set until failure again.\\nSuperman Training\\nThis workout program uses supersets that pair \\nopposing muscle actions. This is a bit different \\nfrom just pairing opposing (antagonist) muscles \\nbecause the exercise pairs are ones where the \\nmovements are the exact opposites. For example, \\nyou will pair the bench press for chest with the \\nbarbell row for lats. However, when you perform \\nthe lat pulldown for lats, you do not pair it with a \\nchest exercises. Rather, you pair shoulder press for \\nthe deltoids with pulldown since these exercises \\nbetter oppose each other’s movement pattern.\\nThe first benefit of supersets done this way is \\ngreater strength and power. Research shows that \\na muscle will contract with more strength and \\npower if preceded by contractions of its antagonist, \\nor opposing muscle group. For example, when \\nyou do a superset of barbell rows followed by \\nthe bench press, you’ll be stronger on the bench \\npress. In fact, Baker and Newton (2005) reported \\nthat when trained athletes performed rows before \\ndoing the bench press throw, they had significantly \\nmore power on the bench press throw than when \\nthey did it without first doing the rows. University \\nof Wisconsin at Parkside (Kenosha) researchers \\n(Ebben et al. 2011) found that when subjects did \\na six-second isometric leg curl to fatigue the ham-\\nstrings before doing the vertical jump, quadriceps \\nforce production increased by almost 15 percent \\ncompared to when they did the vertical jump with-\\nout first doing the leg curl. This phenomenon may \\nbe due to greater inhibition of the antagonist mus-\\ncles. Normally, the muscle you’re working is some-\\nwhat limited by its antagonist muscle, much like a \\nbrake on a car would limit how fast you can go if you \\nkept it depressed. For example, during the bench \\npress, the strength of the pecs is somewhat limited \\nby the contraction of the back muscles. Doing a \\nset of rows before benching, however, lessens this \\ninhibitory effect, allowing the pecs to contract with \\nmore force. Robbins et al. (2010) reported that \\nwhen participants did three supersets of rows and \\nbench presses using their four-rep max on each \\nexercise, they were able to perform more reps on \\nsets 2 and 3 than when they did traditional sets. \\nThis may also be due to the greater inhibition of \\nthe antagonist muscles, but it is also likely due to \\ngetting a longer rest for each muscle group. When \\nyou are training the opposing muscle group, the \\nother muscle group is getting some rest. And when \\nyou combine the rest taken between supersets, \\nthat equates to greater total rest for each muscle \\ngroup. For example, if you do three straight sets of \\nthe bench press with one minute of rest between \\nsets, you get one minute of rest between each \\nset of the bench press. If you do supersets of the \\nbarbell row and the bench press and rested one \\nminute between supersets, then you not only get \\nthe one minute of rest between sets of the bench \\npress, but you also get the time it took to do rows \\nas additional rest time between bench press sets. \\nIn some cases that could double the amount of \\nrest time between sets for each muscle group. \\nRegardless of the reason, being able to complete \\nmore reps with a given weight will lead to greater \\nmuscle strength and growth over time.\\nA second benefit to antagonist superset train -\\ning is that you will burn more body fat. One study \\nfrom Syracuse University (Kelleher et al. 2010) \\nfound that when participants performed super -\\nsets for chest and back, biceps and triceps, and \\nquads and hamstrings, they burned 35 percent \\nmore calories during the workout and 35 percent \\nmore calories after the workout than when they \\ndid straight sets. The big news here is the greater \\ncalorie burn after the workout is over. After all, a \\nworkout may only last one to two hours, so you \\ncan only burn so many extra calories in that time. \\nBut burning 35 percent more calories after the \\nworkout is over when you are sitting around the \\nrest of the day is where that extra calorie and fat'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength152\\nburning can really add up. This is the same main \\nreason why high-intensity interval training (or HIIT) \\noutperforms regular steady-state cardio to help \\nyou drop fat so much quicker. Superset training \\nallows you to burn more calories and fat the rest \\nof the day, which can make a serious dent on your \\nbody fat stores.\\nA third benefit of doing supersets in this fash -\\nion is that you work muscle groups that you’ve \\nlikely neglected. When was the last time that you \\nfocused on your tibialis anterior muscle, or your \\nlower traps? Probably never! This not only helps \\nyou bring up these often-weaker muscle groups, \\nbut it also helps restore balance. Not just bal -\\nanced muscle development, but it helps to remove \\nstrength imbalances that can hold your strength \\nback and predispose you to injury.\\nA fourth benefit of this style of superset training \\nis time management. You will be able to complete \\nfar more sets of exercises in less time. You will \\ncomplete about 40 to 50 total sets of exercises \\nin each workout. Yes, you read that right: 40 to \\n50 total sets! That would normally take well over \\ntwo hours, maybe even close to three hours, to \\ncomplete so much work doing straight sets. Yet \\nwith the Superman training program it will take you \\nonly about 60 to 90 minutes. This will really ramp \\nup the fat burning, not to mention muscle growth.\\nA fifth benefit of this type of training is change. \\nOne of my main mottos is \\nchange is good. Change \\nis critical in making continued progress to get \\nbigger and stronger. That’s why I offer so many \\ntraining programs. So you can keep changing up \\nyour training and keep growing bigger, stronger, \\nleaner, and better. Changing up your training in \\nthis manner is just what your body needs to finally \\nbreak through those plateaus that you’ve been \\nstuck in. When was the last time you did supersets \\nfor every muscle group for every workout? Not to \\nmention when was the last time you did super -\\nsets where every exercise was an exact opposing \\nmotion of the other? Probably never! But I’m not \\njust talking about the change this type of superset \\nprovides. There is also the change in your training \\nsplit. With this program you will work the \\nentire \\nbody in just two days. Then there’s the change in \\nyour training frequency. If you’ve been following \\nmy Shortcut to Size (Micromuscle) program, then \\nyou’ve been training each muscle group just once \\nper week (except for abs and calves). And most \\npeople train each muscle group just once per week \\nin other programs. In the Superman program you \\nwill train each muscle group twice each week. The \\nhigher frequency will help to stimulate new muscle \\ngrowth and strength gains, not to mention greater \\nfat loss.\\nOn top of all the change previously mentioned \\nwill be the change in the rep ranges each week of \\nthis five-week program. The Superman program \\nin table 7.7 uses an pendulum periodization \\nscheme. Weeks 1 to 3 will be done in a linear \\nperiodized scheme where each week the weight \\ngets heavier and the reps get fewer. You will start \\nwith 12 to 15 reps per set on most exercises in \\nweek 1. Then you will move up in weight to limit \\nyou to 8 to 10 reps per set in week 2. And then \\nyou bump up the weight again in week 3 to limit \\nyour muscles to completing just 4 to 6 reps per \\nset. And week 3 is also the starting point for the \\nnext phase of the program because now you will \\nreverse this rep pattern to follow a reverse linear \\nperiodization scheme. You already did 4 to 6 reps \\nper set in week 3, so week 4 jumps back up to 8 \\nto 10 reps per set. And then in week 5 you jump \\nback up to where you started with 12 to 15 reps \\nper set. But you will find that you are suddenly \\nmuch stronger in these rep ranges during weeks \\n4 and 5 as compared to weeks 1 and 2. That’s \\nthe magic of periodization.\\nYou’ll probably like the bigger, stronger, and \\nleaner you that the 5 weeks of this program deliv-\\ners. So if you want to continue with this superset \\nplan, you can do another round to extend the \\nSuperman training program into a 9-week program.'),\n",

The pump is the rapid expan-\\nsion in the size of muscles during a workout. The \\npump simply refers to the filling up of muscle cells \\nwith water. When you work out, you produce waste \\nproducts in the muscle cells. These waste products \\nare the result of burning glucose and fat to fuel \\nmuscle contractions, and their build-up inside muscle \\ncells draws water (from the blood in the capillaries \\nthat feed the muscle and the area surrounding the \\ncells) into the muscle cells. As with a balloon, the \\nmore water that the muscle cell can hold, the bigger \\nthe pump. The pump essentially places a stretch on \\nthe muscle cell. This stretch not only makes muscles \\nmomentarily bigger, but it also initiates biochemical \\npathways that signal the muscle cell to grow.\\nTraining with very high reps causes a greater flow \\nof blood to the trained muscles. It’s the muscle \\ncontraction that stimulates the blood to be directed \\nin that direction. During the superpump program, \\nworkouts focus on just one or two muscle groups \\nper session (see table 7.8). Each muscle group \\nwill be trained just once a week with high reps \\nand multiple sets. The workouts focus on isolation \\nexercises and cables for constant tension and \\nemploy techniques such as preexhaust, supersets, \\ncompound sets, tri-sets, and drop sets. Keep rest \\nto no more than 90 seconds between sets or as \\nspecified for each training protocol. Follow this pro-\\ngram for no more than six weeks before switching \\nto a program that uses heavier weight and lower \\nreps. After that, you can go back to the superpump \\nprogram for maximizing muscle pumps during the \\nworkout and creating long-term muscle growth.\\nMONDAY: CHEST, CALVES\\nExercise Sets Reps Notes\\nIncline dumbbell \\nfly\\n4 12 Do each set to failure.\\nIncline bench \\npress\\n4 12-15 Drop set on last set. \\nDrop weight 30 percent \\nand continue to failure.\\nDumbbell bench \\npress\\n4 12-15 Drop set on last set. \\nDrop weight 30 percent \\nand continue to failure.\\nPec deck 4 20-30 Keep rest between \\nsets to less than 30 \\nseconds.\\nStanding calf \\nraise\\n5 20-30 Keep rest between \\nsets to less than 30 \\nseconds.\\nSeated calf raise 5 20-30 Keep rest between \\nsets to less than 30 \\nseconds.\\nTUESDAY: BACK, ABS\\nExercise Sets Reps Notes\\nStraight-arm \\npulldown\\n3 12-15 Do each set to failure.\\nBarbell row 4 12-15 Drop set on last set. \\nDrop weight 30 percent \\nand continue to failure.\\nWide-grip and \\nunderhand-grip \\npulldown \\n4 12-15 Perform these as com-\\npound sets.\\nStraight-arm \\npulldown\\n4 20-30 Keep rest between \\nsets to less than 30 \\nseconds.\\nHanging leg \\nraise\\n4 12-15 Keep rest between \\nsets to less than 30 \\nseconds.\\nCrunch 4 15-25 Keep rest between \\nsets to less than 30 \\nseconds.\\nTABLE 7.8 Superpump Program'),\n",

For some, this is due to an \\nimbalance in their overall muscle development—\\noften caused by genetics or improper training. For \\nothers, this is due to simple desire for having cer-\\ntain muscle groups (often the biceps) as large as \\npossible. If you have a particular muscle group that \\nyou want to concentrate on developing, try one of \\nthe following muscle-specific programs. There is a \\nspecific program for each major muscle group. Each \\nprogram is tried and true in application and results.\\nBig Chest Program\\nBig pecs are the signature body part of a serious \\nbodybuilder. If your chest is a weak spot on your \\nphysique, try following the big chest program \\nshown in table 7.9. It is a 16-week program broken \\ndown into four separate phases that alter exercise \\nselection, training techniques used, weight and rep \\nranges, number of sets, and even rest periods.\\nDuring this program you should alternate between \\na four-day and five-day training split. During weeks 1, \\n3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 you will train chest twice \\nper week while training all other muscle groups just \\nonce. For this you will use a four-day split that trains \\nchest and abs on Monday and Friday; shoulders \\nand triceps on Tuesday; back, biceps, and abs on \\nWednesday; and legs and calves on Thursday. During \\nweeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 you train chest once \\nper week using a five-day split that works chest and \\nabs on Monday; legs and calves on Tuesday; shoul-\\nders and abs on Wednesday; back on Thursday; and \\nbiceps, triceps, and abs on Friday.\\nPhase 1 is designed to build mass and strength; \\ntherefore, it involves mainly compound exercises \\ndone for low reps.

The lower half of the body seems \\nto get neglected in an effort to focus on the more \\nobvious muscle groups of the upper body, such as \\nthe arms and chest. If you’ve been guilty of neglect-\\ning your leg training, or if you are wise enough to \\nrealize that muscular legs are just as important \\nas a muscular upper body to produce a balanced \\nphysique, try this big wheels program to pack on \\nmuscle to your quads and hams.\\nThe 16-week big wheels program (see table 7.10) \\nis broken down into four 4-week phases. Phase \\n1 kicks off with a high-intensity training (HIT) leg \\nprogram that uses heavy weight. As discussed in \\nchapter 6, this training method uses high-intensity \\nmethods and low volume. Precede each set with \\none short warm-up set with approximately 50 per-\\ncent of the weight you will use for the working set. \\nTake each working set to muscle failure. In addition, \\nyou should have a spotter help you perform three \\nor four forced reps after reaching muscle failure. \\nResist the negative portion on every forced rep. \\nPerform the HIT leg workout on Monday and Friday \\n(add abs following the Friday workout). Train chest, \\nback, and abs on Tuesday; train shoulders, biceps, \\nand triceps on Wednesday. Take Thursday off.\\nPhase 2 training drops the workouts back to \\none per week as the volume and reps increase \\ndramatically. It also uses supersets and preexhaust \\ntechniques to keep the intensity high. This phase \\nshould be done as a five-day split, training legs \\non Monday; chest and abs on Tuesday; shoulders \\nand traps on Wednesday; back on Thursday; and \\ntriceps, biceps, and calves on Friday. In addition to \\nthis training in the gym, in phase 2 you kick-start the \\n50–50 method for dumbbell squats (see chapter \\n6 for details). You will follow the 50–50 program \\nthrough phase 3 for a total of eight weeks. Use light \\ndumbbells and perform one set of 50 reps of dumb-\\nbell squats in the morning and at night, every day.\\nPhase 3 drops the reps down to 10 to 12 per \\nset, except on leg extensions where you will do \\nthree sets of 21 (see chapter 6 for details). Leg \\ntraining goes back to twice per week as you’ll use \\nthe same split in weeks 1 to 4.\\nTABLE 7.10 Big Wheels Program\\nPHASE 1: WEEKS 1-4\\nExercise Sets Reps\\nLeg extension 1 10-12\\nSmith machine squat 1 6-8\\nLeg press 1 6-8\\nHack squat 1 6-8\\nRomanian deadlift 1 6-8\\nLying leg curl 1 10-12\\nSeated leg curl 1 10-12\\nStanding calf raise 1 12-15\\nSeated calf raise 1 12-15\\nLeg press calf raise 1 12-15\\nPHASE 2: WEEKS 5-8\\nLeg extension 5 20\\nSuperset with lying leg curl 5 20\\nSquats 5 20\\nLeg press 5 20\\nRomanian deadlift 5 20\\nPHASE 3: WEEKS 9-12\\nSquat 4 10-12\\nHack squat 4 10-12\\nLeg extension 3 21s\\nLying leg curl 4 10-12\\nStanding calf raise 4 10-12\\nCompound set with donkey calf raise 4 10-12\\nPHASE 4: WEEKS 13-16\\nMORNING: QUADS\\nLeg extension 3 8-10\\nSquat 3 8-10\\nLeg press 3 8-10\\nHack squat 3 8-10\\nWalking lunge 3 20\\nOne-leg leg extension 3 8-10\\nEVENING: HAMSTRINGS, CALVES\\nLying leg curl 3 8-10\\nRomanian deadlift 3 8-10\\nStanding leg curl 3 8-10\\nSeated leg curl 3 8-10\\nSeated calf raise 3 8-10\\nDonkey calf raise 3 8-10\\nStanding calf raise 3 8-10\\nLeg press calf raise 3 8-10'),\n",

Because \\nof this, the volume is very high, with multiple exer-\\ncises for each muscle group. Follow the same split \\nas done in phase 2. The reps drop back to 8 to \\n10 per set for optimal muscle gains.\\nCalves to Cows Program\\nCalves seem to be the one muscle group of the \\nlower body that few bodybuilders have developed \\nto their satisfaction, and it’s also the one muscle \\ngroup that so many want to develop. Unfortunately, \\nif you aren’t genetically predisposed to building \\nbig calves, you will have to work extremely hard \\nfor every ounce of muscle you can add to them. \\nThe calves to cows program (see table 7.11) is for \\nthose bodybuilders who need to work their calves \\nhard and diligently. This program is divided into four \\n4-week phases that change up the rep range and \\nweight used, the volume, and the training frequency \\nin a specific pattern. Each phase reduces the fre-\\nquency at which you train the calves as well as the \\nrep range, but it increases the volume (number of \\nsets and exercises performed) and weight used.\\nPhase 1 starts off with training the calves five \\ndays a week. Use a basic five-day training split \\nduring this phase and train calves at the end of \\nevery workout. Reps are extremely high but volume \\nis fairly low. Phase 2 increases the exercise number \\nand the sets performed to four per exercise, but it \\ndrops the training frequency back to four days per \\nweek. You can use a four- or five-day training split \\nduring this phase. Reps decrease to about 15 to \\n20 per set. In phase 3, the frequency decreases \\nto three times per week, but an extra calf exer -\\ncise is added and compound-set training is used. \\nReps drop down to 12 to 15 per set. You can use \\na three-, four-, or five-day basic training split during \\nthis period of calf training. The final phase, phase 4, \\ntrains calves only twice per week. Sounds simple, \\nbut it increases the number of exercises performed \\nand includes drop sets on the last set of every \\nexercise. After you reach failure on the last set, \\ndrop the weight about 30 percent and repeat that \\ntwice. You can do this phase with any type of split.\\nSix Weeks to Sick Arms\\nRegardless of where you’re starting from, this \\nsix-week program will put noticeable size on your \\narms. You might expect to add an inch or more to \\nthe arms. This six-week program is a progression \\nthat ramps up the training frequency (how often you \\ntrain arms each week) starting at once per week in \\nweek 1, twice per week in week 2, and three times \\nper week in weeks 3 through 5, and then backing \\nway off in the final week 6 to just once per week \\nagain. There is a method to this madness.\\nWeek one will annihilate your biceps and triceps. \\nYou’ll pull out all the stops, using negative-rep train-\\ning to destroy every single muscle fiber in the arms. \\nYou’ll need a good week to recover from this. The \\nnext week gets involves light weight and high reps. \\nVolume will be low on these workouts because \\nyou’ll still be recovering from the previous week. \\nThese workouts will help you to recover from the \\nprevious week and will get you ready for the crazy \\nthree weeks that are to come. In weeks 3, 4, and 5 \\nyou will be hitting arms three times per week. If you \\nthink that sounds like overtraining, you're right. But \\novertraining does not happen immediately. It takes \\nseveral weeks to actually become overtrained.

And what's interesting about \\noverreaching is that research shows that if your diet \\nis adequate in calories, protein, and carbohydrate, \\nas well as the right supplements, then you can \\nactually capitalize on overreaching and turn it into a \\nway to get bigger and stronger. But don't worry. I've \\ngot you covered on a diet and supplement plan to \\nensure that you turn the training into distinct gains. \\nSeveral studies from the University of Connecticut \\n(Ratamess et al. 2003; Kraemer et al. 2006) have \\nshown that when participants overreach for several \\nweeks, during the two weeks following, they grow \\nsignificantly bigger and stronger while taking it easy. \\nThe key is to stop the overreaching just before it \\nturns into overtraining. That’s why you’ll be training \\narms three times per week in weeks 3 through 5 \\nand then switch it up to just once per week in week \\n6. I also suggest that the week after week 6 you \\ntake it fairly easy on your arms and train them just \\nonce that week before getting back into any serious \\ntraining programs.\\nNot only will the three-day-a-week arm training \\nshock your muscles into growing with frequent and \\nintense workouts that cause overreaching, but it \\nalso takes advantage of the staircase effect for \\nbuilding muscle. This refers to the fact that training \\nactivates genes in muscle fibers that are respon-\\nsible for many of the adaptations that take place, \\nsuch as muscle growth and increased strength. \\nFor example, consistent training activates certain \\ngenes that result in building more muscle fiber \\nprotein, which means more size and strength. \\nThese genes are typically activated a few hours, \\nand some remain activated for days. Repeated \\nworkouts, if timed appropriately, can build on the \\nactivation of the genes to reach an even higher \\nactivity level and thus greater muscle growth. \\nThis is referred to as the staircase effect.\\n\\xa0In other \\nwords, let’s say a certain gene involved in muscle \\ngrowth is activated by a workout to the point that \\nthat its activity is boosted by 100 percent after the \\nworkout, then slowly declines in activity over the \\nnext few days so that the day after the workout it is \\nstill up by 75 percent, and the second day after the \\nworkout it is up by 50 percent, then the third day it \\nis up by just 25 percent, and finally on the fourth \\nday after the workout it is back to the original level. \\nIf you performed the workout on the fourth day after \\nthe first workout or later, then that gene would be \\nbumped back to 100 percent of its original activ-\\nity. However, if you worked out on the second day \\nafter the first workout, when the gene was still up \\nby 50 percent, then you could potentially bump up \\nits activity to 150 percent. This could lead to even \\ngreater muscle growth and strength gains than if \\nyou waited to train again after the fourth day or \\nlater, such as one week later. This is one reason \\ntraining a muscle group every 48 hours could lead \\nto even greater muscle growth and strength gains \\nthan training every seven days.\\nOf course, this program is not all about training \\nfrequency. While moving to more frequent workouts \\ncan help you to build extra size on your arms, to \\nreally get them up there in size will require pulling \\nout all the stops. So intensity techniques, like drop \\nsets, forced reps, rest, negative reps, and super-\\nsets, will be key in forcing them to grow. These \\ntechniques not only put more stress on the muscle, \\nbut they are also known to boost growth hormone \\nlevels. In fact, one study from Finland (Ahtianen et \\nal. 2003) reported that participants doing forced \\nreps increased GH levels three times higher than \\nwhen they just stopped after reaching muscle fail-\\nure. That extra growth hormone will be put to good \\nuse initiating muscle recovery and growth. Yarrow \\net al. (2007) reported that using negative-rep train-\\ning leads to high GH levels. Another key element \\nto this program is the constant switching up of \\nweight and rep ranges every workout (undulating \\nperiodization) to keep your arms growing.\\nBecause you’ll be training arms pretty much \\nevery other day during weeks 3, 4, and 5, you may \\nbe worried about your arms still being sore when \\nyou train them. Don’t be. Nosaka and Newton \\n(2002) showed that when participants work out \\nintensely to cause muscle pain and train that \\nmuscle again just two days later and again four \\ndays later when the muscle is still sore, it does \\nnot impede recovery. Plus this can actually help \\nmuscles grow. Pullinen et al. (2002) found that \\nwhen participants trained the same muscle group \\njust two days, the catabolic hormone cortisol was \\nlower. Since cortisol competes with testosterone, \\nhaving lower cortisol levels during and after work-\\nouts can make you more anabolic and allow your \\ntestosterone to better enhance muscle growth.\\nTo properly hit your arms during these six \\nweeks, you’ll need to alternate your training split. \\nEach week you will follow a four-day training split. \\nHowever, based on the week and number of times \\nyou are training arms, you will be training on four \\ndays of the week and pairing up different muscle \\ngroups each week. Use the training splits in table \\n7.12 for each week of the Six Weeks to Sick Arms \\nprogram (see table 7.13).\"),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength172\\nTraining for maximal strength is much different \\nfrom training for muscle mass. From a training \\nstandpoint, the total volume and reps performed \\nper set tend to be lower when training for strength \\ncompared to the volume and number of reps when \\ntraining for muscle mass. From a physiological \\nstandpoint, muscle growth tends to be more about \\nthe aftereffects of training, while muscle strength \\nalso has a learning component that develops \\nduring the actual workouts. Even though mechan-\\nical stress and metabolic stress are important \\nfactors for developing muscle strength, there is \\na large component to strength development that \\nrelies on training of the nervous system.\\nMotor nerves that run from the spinal cord to the \\nmuscle fibers are responsible for initiating muscle \\ncontractions. Strength training increases muscle \\nstrength through several adaptations of the motor \\nnerves. One mechanism involves training the \\nmotor nerves to fire at a faster rate. This allows \\nthe muscle fibers to contract with more force (that \\nis, greater strength). Strength training also trains \\nthe motor nerves to fire at this faster rate for a \\nlonger period without fatiguing, This allows more \\nreps to be done with a certain amount of weight. \\nAnother mechanism that leads to enhanced \\nstrength is synchronization of motor nerves. This \\nrefers to the ability of motor nerves that control \\nvarious muscle fibers within the same muscle to \\nfire at the precise time to allow for the greatest \\nproduction of muscle force.\\nWhat is similar between training programs for \\nmaximizing muscle strength and programs for \\nmaximizing muscle growth is that both trial and \\nerror in the gym and research in the laboratory have \\ndefined the training techniques and programs that \\nwork best at encouraging strength gains. Part III will \\nteach you how to train for maximal strength. Chap-\\nter 8 covers basic workouts for building strength. \\nThis chapter starts with a lesson on weekly train-\\ning splits that are optimal for building strength \\nregardless of your training schedule. From there \\nit progresses to general guidelines for training to \\nmaximize strength gains. Finally, it covers training \\ntips and strategies for maximizing muscle strength \\non the three major strength lifts (bench press, \\nsquat, deadlift) as well as rules for training the core.\\nChapter 9 introduces you to advanced training \\ntechniques that will have you lifting more weight \\nin no time. These techniques work to increase \\nmechanical and metabolic stress as well as \\nenhance the firing rate and synchronicity of motor \\nnerves.\\nChapter 10 provides long-term periodized train-\\ning cycles that will help you continually improve \\nyour strength without plateauing. It starts by \\nteaching you how to test your maximal strength, \\na critical component for assessing your progress \\nover the course of any strength training cycle. From \\nthere, you can pick a training cycle that best fits \\nyour training experience and follow the sequencing \\ncycles. Or you can follow a cycle that is specific to \\nthe exercise in which you want to boost strength. \\nRegardless of your training experience or specific \\nstrength goals, this section covers everything you \\nneed to know to realize your strength potential.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\n173\\nCHAPTER 8\\nTactics for Maximizing \\nStrength\\nThe first step toward getting stronger is learning \\nhow to develop workouts and basic training pro -\\ngrams with that goal in mind. The variables you \\nwill need to consider for developing strength train-\\ning workouts, as discussed in chapter 2, are the \\nchoice of exercises you will perform, the order of \\nthose exercises, how many sets of each exercise \\nyou will do, how heavy a weight you will use on \\nthose exercises, and how much rest you will allow \\nbetween sets. Furthermore, you will also need to \\nconsider how often to train each muscle group and \\nwhat type of training split you will employ.\\nThis chapter focuses on the common training \\nsplits used by lifters interested in maximizing \\nmuscle strength. This will help you determine \\nthe best weekly schedule to follow for increasing \\nmuscle strength. From there the chapter steps \\nback to focus on the variables of each workout. \\nThen it steps back again to focus on the details of \\nthe specific exercises. Each step gives you more \\ndetail regarding guidelines, techniques, and tips \\nfor maximizing your muscle strength.\\nWEEKLY SPLITS\\nRegardless of whether your goal is to develop \\nstrength or muscle mass, the easiest way to split \\nup your training is to work within the confines of \\nthe week. Although the body doesn’t specifically \\nfollow a seven-day cycle, for practical purposes, \\na seven-day strength training cycle makes sense \\nwith most people’s schedules. The following splits \\nfor developing strength all follow a seven-day cycle \\nand will fit anyone’s schedule and level of strength \\ntraining experience.\\nOne common denominator of these splits is \\nthat they focus on training three major strength \\nlifts—the bench press (the marker for upper-\\nbody strength), squats (the marker for lower-body \\nstrength), and deadlifts (the marker for overall \\nbody strength). These also are the three lifts \\nthat are involved in powerlifting competition. \\nTypically, the resistance used on these three \\nexercises is expressed as a percentage of the \\nweightlifter’s one-repetition max (1RM), while all \\nother exercises are expressed as an RM target \\nzone—the resistance that limits a lifter to a \\nspecific number of repetitions. This is because \\npowerlifters and others interested in training for \\nstrength frequently test their 1RM on the three \\nmajor exercises.\\nBecause training for maximal strength typically \\ninvolves training with the three major strength \\nexercises, as opposed to training a multitude of \\nmuscle groups, there tend to be fewer commonly \\nused training splits. This does not mean that there \\nare a limited number of ways to split up a strength \\ntraining program. The following training splits are \\nthose that are well accepted by the majority of \\nstrength experts and athletes.\\nWhole-Body Strength Training\\nWhole-body strength training refers to single \\nworkouts that stress most major muscle groups \\nof the body. This training split allows for most \\nmajor muscle groups to be trained three times \\nper week—usually Monday, Wednesday, and \\nFriday. Many experts believe that frequency of \\ntraining is important for gaining strength. In fact, \\nmany strength coaches have their athletes follow'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength174\\na whole-body training system. Not only do they \\nthink the frequency of training is important, but \\nmost also believe that because the body works \\nas a whole unit, it should be trained accordingly. \\nTherefore, a whole-body strength training split \\ncan be an effective means of increasing overall \\nstrength.\\nThe frequency offered by whole-body strength \\ntraining is also beneficial for beginners. As dis -\\ncussed in chapter 5, this is because the initial \\nadaptations made in a strength training program \\ninvolve the training of the nervous system. The \\nbest way for beginners to train to build strength \\nis to use slightly higher repetitions than trained \\nlifters use and more frequent training of the same \\nexercises to program their nervous systems.\\nThe workouts on a whole-body split typically \\ninclude one exercise per major muscle group. The \\nexercise choices usually include the bench press, \\nsquat, and deadlift, or similar exercises that mimic \\nthose particular exercises, as well as assistance \\nexercises that help with increasing strength on \\nthese particular exercises. Most weightlifters who \\nuse a whole-body split do not train small muscle \\ngroups (such as traps, forearms, and calves) in \\norder to better concentrate on the muscles that \\nare directly involved in the bench press, squat, \\nand deadlift.\\nWhen you are following a whole-body training \\nsplit, the first exercise of the workout should \\nalternate between the bench press, squat, and \\ndeadlift. That way, each major strength exercise \\nis trained once per week when the body is fresh. \\nSome powerlifters also include one extra assis -\\ntance exercise for the exercise they are focusing \\non in that workout. For example, in table 8.1, \\non Monday, leg press is done in addition to the \\nsquat.\\nTABLE 8.1 Whole-Body Strength Training Split\\nWORKOUT 1 (MONDAY): SQUAT FOCUS\\nExercise Sets\\n% 1RM \\nor reps\\nSquat 4 85%\\nLeg press 3 8-10\\nIncline bench press 4 6-8\\nDumbbell shoulder press 3 6-8\\nBarbell row 3 6-8\\nStiff-leg deadlift 3 6-8\\nClose-grip bench press 3 6-8\\nDumbbell curl 3 8-10\\nHanging leg raise 3 10-12\\nWORKOUT 2 (WEDNESDAY): BENCH PRESS FOCUS\\nBench press 4 85%\\nDumbbell bench press 3 8-10\\nBarbell hack squat 3 6-8\\nBarbell shoulder press 3 6-8\\nDeadlift 3 80%\\nDumbbell row 3 8-10\\nTriceps dip 3 8-10\\nBarbell curl 3 6-8\\nCable woodchopper 3 20\\nWORKOUT 3 (FRIDAY): DEADLIFT FOCUS\\nDeadlift 4 85%\\nOne-arm dumbbell deadlift 3 8-10\\nBench press 3 8-10\\nUpright row 3 6-8\\nLat pulldown 3 8-10\\nLying triceps extension 3 6-8\\nPreacher curl 3 8-10\\nBack extension 3 15-20'),\n",

Pushing exercises \\ninclude any exercise in which the positive (con -\\ncentric) portion of the exercise involves pushing or \\npressing the weight away from the body (such as \\nin the bench press and shoulder press) or pushing \\nthe body away from the floor or platform (such as \\nin the squat). Pull exercises include any exercise \\nin which the positive (concentric) action involves \\npulling the weight toward the body (such as in the \\nbiceps curl, barbell row, or leg curl) or pulling the \\nbody toward a fixed object (such as in the pull-up).\\nThe reason that some weightlifters split their \\nworkouts into push-and-pull workouts is that those \\nexercises involve similar muscle groups working \\ntogether to perform the exercise. For example, \\nthe pectoralis, deltoid, and triceps muscles are all \\nused to varying degrees during the bench press \\nand the shoulder press.\\nPush-and-pull training allows for each workout to \\nbe done twice a week for a total of four workouts \\nper week, as shown in table 8.2. On push day, it \\nis wise to alternate between the bench press and \\nthe squat as the starting exercise.\\nUpper- and Lower-Body  \\nPowerlifting Split\\nThis split divides workouts into an upper-body \\nworkout day and a lower-body workout day.

In addition, they \\nmay use one workout to emphasize the pushing \\nassistance muscles (such as shoulders and tri -\\nceps), while the other upper-body workout focuses \\non the pulling assistance muscles (such as back \\nand biceps). For lower-body workouts, most power-\\nlifters split the two workouts into a squat emphasis \\nand quadriceps assistance exercise workout and \\na deadlift emphasis and hamstring assistance \\nexercise workout.\\nMax Effort–Dynamic Effort  \\nTraining Split\\nThis training split is basically a modified ver -\\nsion of the upper- and lower-body powerlifting \\nsplit. Each split trains the entire body in two \\ndays, which allows for four workouts per week. \\nThe major difference that separates max \\neffort–dynamic effort from upper- and lower-body \\ntraining split is the specific amount of resistance \\nused during the max effort–dynamic effort split. \\nFor details of the max effort–dynamic effort \\nmethod, see chapter 9.\\nWith the max effort–dynamic effort training split, \\nthe first two workouts of the week are done using \\nthe max effort system (see table 8.4). This calls \\nfor a gradual buildup of weight on each successive \\nset of the bench press, squat, or deadlift until you \\nreach 90 to 95 percent of 1RM. Some lifters go \\nto 100 percent on some workouts.\\nDuring the last two workouts of the week, the \\nweight used on the bench press, squat, and dead-\\nlift is only 50 to 60 percent of the 1RM. Although \\nmost people can lift this amount of weight for about \\n20 reps, these sets stop at 3 to 5 reps. The key \\nis in the rep speed at which they are performed. \\nDuring the dynamic effort workouts, these reps \\nare performed as fast as possible.\\nLOWER-BODY WORKOUT 1\\n(MONDAY): MAX EFFORT (continued)\\nExercise Sets Reps % 1RM\\nRomanian deadlift 3 4-6 85%\\nBarbell good morning 3 6-8 80%\\nExercise-ball roll-out 3 12-15 Body weight\\nUPPER-BODY WORKOUT 1\\n(TUESDAY): MAX EFFORT\\nExercise Sets Reps % 1RM\\nBench press 1 5 10%\\n1 5 20%\\n1 5 30%\\n1 3 40%\\n1 3 50%\\n1 3 60%\\n1 1 70%\\n1 1 80%\\n1 1 90%\\n1 1 95%\\n1 1 100%\\nDumbbell bench press 3 4-6 85%\\nBarbell shoulder press 3 4-6 85%\\nClose-grip bench press 3 4-6 85%\\nBarbell row 3 4-6 85%\\nBarbell curl 3 6-8 80%\\nHanging knee raise 3 10 Body weight\\nTABLE 8.4 Max Effort–Dynamic Effort Training Split\\nLOWER-BODY WORKOUT 1\\n(MONDAY): MAX EFFORT\\nExercise Sets Reps % 1RM\\nSquat 1 5 10%\\n1 5 20%\\n1 5 30%\\n1 3 40%\\n1 3 50%\\n1 3 60%\\n1 1 70%\\n1 1 80%\\n1 1 90%\\n1 1 95%\\n1 1 100%\\nDeadlift 1 5 10%\\n1 5 20%\\n1 5 30%\\n1 3 40%\\n1 3 50%\\n1 3 60%\\n1 1 70%\\n1 1 80%\\n1 1 90%\\n1 1 95%\\n1 1 100%'),\n",

All focus \\non training the three major strength lifts; a secondary focus is on training the assistance exercises \\nfor these three strength lifts. Because of this, changing the strength training split every few months \\nis one way to institute another form of variation in the training program. However, most competitive \\npowerlifters have one training split that they stick with year round. Therefore, if you find a certain \\ntraining split that works better for your schedule, you can potentially use it endlessly.\\nESSENTIALS OF STRENGTH \\nPROGRAMS\\nThe type of training split you decide to follow is \\nnot as critical a factor for successful strength \\ngains as the proper choice of exercises, exercise \\norder, resistance, and volume. Regardless of the \\nsplit you employ for developing strength, there \\nare certain rules of success to follow. Follow \\nthese general rules to ensure that your training is \\noptimal for strength gains. In addition, the three \\nmajor strength lifts are covered in detail. That’s \\nbecause you can’t properly increase your strength \\non these lifts without being proficient in the proper \\ntechnique for each. Last but not least, the chapter \\ncovers core training. You must have a strong core \\nto transfer strength to the limbs. Once you have \\nthese fundamentals of strength training, you will \\nbe ready to advance to the techniques for boosting \\nstrength (chapter 9).\\nGeneral Rules of Strength Training\\nTraining for muscle mass uses exercises as a \\nmeans to an end. Training for maximal strength, \\non the other hand, does not use exercises merely \\nas tools. Instead, training for strength is about \\nincreasing performance on the exercises. For most \\nweightlifters, the exercises they train are the bench \\npress, squat, and deadlift. Therefore, the first and \\nmost obvious rule is that you should include these \\nthree exercises in your program. You should also \\ninclude assistance exercises to help you boost \\nstrength on the bench press, squat, and deadlift. \\nThese choices involve multijoint compound exer -\\ncises, where appropriate.\\nOrder of exercises is important as well—the \\nbench press, squat, and deadlift should each be \\nperformed first in the workout at least once per \\nweek. Following the major lift should be the assis-\\ntance exercises. The second exercise should be a \\ncompound exercise that targets the major muscle \\ngroup used in each of the three exercises. The \\nthird exercise and any others that follow should \\nbe those that target muscle groups that assist the \\nmajor strength exercise.\\nThe amount of resistance used is of paramount \\nimportance to your strength gains. For the three \\nmajor strength exercises, the resistance used is \\ntypically expressed as a percent of the 1RM. This \\nis convenient because the 1RM for these lifts is \\nfrequently tested by those who are interested in \\nincreasing their maximal strength. For strength \\ngains, the majority of training time should be spent \\nusing a load between 85 and 95 percent of the \\n1RM. Of course, cycling the training load is wise \\nfor making continued gains in strength. In fact, \\nloads as light as 50 percent RM are often used \\nby weightlifters to increase power, which helps to \\nboost strength. The resistance for the assistance \\nexercises is usually expressed as a specific repe-\\ntition maximum (RM). These will often correspond \\nwith the percent RM. For example, if the squat \\nis being trained with 85 percent of the RM, the \\nleg press should be performed using a rep range \\nof about four to six. Regardless of the exercise, \\nmuscle failure should be reached only on one set \\nper exercise at the maximum. Many powerlifters \\nrarely, if ever, train to muscle failure. However, \\nresearch from Australia suggests that training \\nto muscle failure on one set per exercise and no \\nmore is better for strength gains than not training \\nto failure or training to failure two or more times \\nper exercise (Drinkwater et al. 2005).\\nVolume per workout is generally low when train-\\ning for strength. For the major strength exercises, \\ntypically as few as three to as many as eight sets \\nare done per exercise. For assistance exercises, \\nusually three or four sets are performed per exer-\\ncise. For an entire workout, total volume can be as \\nlow as 12 to as high as 30 sets or more, depending \\non the split being used and the training phase.'),\n",

Research and years of experience \\nsupport a narrow spectrum of exercise choices, \\nexercise order, resistance, volume, and even rest \\nperiods that are effective in the quest for strength. \\nYet, as the saying goes, rules are meant to be \\nbroken. As important as it is to follow rules for \\nstrength training, breaking from the norm from time \\nto time can be an effective means of improving \\nstrength. This is especially true during plateaus, \\nwhen standard training practices fail to work. The \\ntraining strategies in chapter 9 will challenge the \\ntried-and-true rules that most strength athletes \\nhave adopted as standard training guidelines. \\nKnowing how and when to use them will make a \\nworld of difference in the strength gains you can \\nexpect from your training program.\\nBench Press Training\\nTo many people, strength is all about the bench \\npress. Rarely does a heavily muscled athlete field \\nthe question “How much can you squat?” The \\nquestion everyone wants to know is “How much \\ncan you bench-press?” Of course, masculinity is \\noften associated with strong and well-developed \\nupper-body musculature, and the bench press \\nis the marker for this strength. The bench press \\ndevelops the major muscles of the upper body—\\nchest, shoulders, triceps, and even the back to \\nsome extent.\\nAnother reason so many people associate \\nstrength solely with the bench press may be the \\nfact that of the three major strength exercises, \\nthe bench press is the easiest to perform. Almost \\nanyone can walk into a gym and bench-press with \\nrelative ease and safety. Whatever the reason, the \\nbench press is the preeminent strength exercise.\\nWhen it comes to training strategies for boost-\\ning strength in the bench press, regardless of \\nthe training split being used, exercise choice and \\norder are critical factors. Of course, strength in \\nthe bench press cannot be optimally enhanced \\nwithout actually performing the bench press reg -\\nularly. This is known as the specificity principle. \\nOn bench press training days, you should perform \\nthe bench press first while the muscle fibers are \\nfully recovered from any previous exercise. This \\nensures that the muscles can handle the maximal \\nload they are capable of for the specific number \\nof reps prescribed for that workout.\\nAfter the bench press, you should do one other \\nchest-pressing assistance exercise, such as the \\nincline or decline barbell press or dumbbell press \\n(flat, incline, or decline). On occasion, you can do \\nchest isolation exercises instead. However, isola-\\ntion exercises are rarely used unless the weight -\\nlifter is in the hypertrophy phase of training. This \\nis because the isolation exercises do not mimic \\nthe pressing motion of the bench press. Chest \\nexercises are usually followed with one shoulder \\nexercise and one triceps exercise. These are pref-\\nerentially compound exercises, such as shoulder \\npress or upright row for shoulders and dips or \\nclose-grip bench press for triceps. On occasion \\nthese can be isolation exercises. Depending on \\nthe split used, one back and one biceps exercise \\nmay conclude the bench press workout, or you \\nmay train these on separate pull exercise days. \\nSee table 8.6 for a sample bench press workout.\\nSets performed on the bench press should typi-\\ncally fall in the range of three to five, not including \\nwarm-up sets. All assistance exercises are usually \\nlimited to three sets per exercise. The weight used \\non the bench press should start off light (10 to 50 \\npercent RM) and gradually work up to the heavy \\nsets in the range of 85 to 95 percent RM. This is \\nthe range that most workouts are performed in, \\nTABLE 8.6 Big Bench Day\\nThis workout is for a powerlifter who has a maximum \\nbench press of 495 pounds and is training with 90 \\npercent of his or her maximum.\\nExercise Sets\\nWeight \\n(pounds) Reps Rest\\nBench press 1 135 10* 1 min\\n1 225 8* 1 min\\n1 315 6* 2 min\\n1 365 5* 2 min\\n1 405 3* 3 min\\n3 445 3** 3-4 min\\nIncline bench \\npress\\n3 375 4-6** 3 min\\nBarbell shoulder \\npress\\n3 255 4-6** 3 min\\nClose-grip bench \\npress\\n3 385 4-6** 3 min\\nStanding crunch 4 110 8-10** 1 min\\n*Warm-up sets.\\n**Working sets.'),\n",

This helps to stabilize your \\nbody. Your knees should be bent at about a 90-degree angle.\\nMaintain a slight arch in your lower back throughout the \\nexercise and keep your shoulders and glutes pressed into \\nthe bench. Keep your glute muscles tightly contracted during \\nthe entire exercise.\\nGRIP\\nTake a grip that is slightly wider than shoulder width on the bar. \\nTo determine the best grip for your arm length, make sure that \\nwhen the bar reaches your chest there is a 90-degree angle at \\nthe shoulder and the elbow.\\nBe sure to wrap your thumb around the bar. Make sure you \\nsqueeze the bar as hard as possible. This creates a solid \\nconnection to the bar by allowing the force developed by the \\nchest, shoulder, and triceps muscles to be more effectively \\ntransmitted to the bar.\\nLOWERING THE BAR\\nLift the bar off the rack to the point where it is over your upper \\nchest. This is your starting position.\\nSqueeze your scapulae together while lowering the bar. This \\nstabilizes the shoulder girdle and will help you recruit the lats \\nto push the weight up.\\nLower the bar slowly. This allows the stored energy from the \\ndescent and the elastic properties of the muscles to produce \\nmore force on the lift.\\ndepending on the training phase. Weight may go as \\nhigh as 100 percent RM to as low as 50 percent \\nRM for some working sets during specific training \\nphases of the cycle. For the assistance exercises, \\nreps typically correspond with the percent RM \\nbeing used in that workout on the bench press. \\nSo reps tend to fall mostly in the range of 2 to 10 \\nreps for assistance exercises, depending on the \\ntraining phase.\\nRest periods between sets should be longer \\nthan when training for muscle size. The exact \\ntime is not as critical as the fact that the body \\nis mostly recovered from the previous set. When \\ntraining for strength, fatigue is not as critical as \\nit is for building muscle size. Therefore, resting \\nanywhere from two to five minutes is common \\npractice. A detailed description of the proper exer-\\ncise technique for the bench press exercise can \\nbe found in the Big Bench Tips box and in chapter \\n14. Technique is a critical factor when training for \\nstrength. The program you follow will not matter \\nmuch to your strength gains if you do not perfect \\nyour technique in the bench press.\\nSquat Training\\nThe squat is the exercise that defines lower-body \\nstrength. Although it’s categorized as a leg exercise, \\nthe squat technically functions as a whole-body \\nstrength and mass builder. It has been estimated \\nthat more than 200 muscles are involved in exe -\\ncuting the squat. In addition, the surge in growth \\na\\nb'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\n181Tactics for Maximizing Strength\\nARMS\\nYour upper arms should form a 45- to 60-degree angle with your torso as you lower and press the \\nweight back up.\\nTOUCHDOWN\\nWhen the bar reaches your chest, it should touch across the nipples, not much lower.\\nPRESSING THE BAR\\nBefore you push the weight back up, dig your shoulders into the bench and keep your butt on the \\nbench. This stabilizes your shoulder capsule and keeps the bar moving upward in a straight line.\\nYou need to explode the weight off your chest as quickly and powerfully as possible. Think about \\nblasting the bar off your chest as if it weighed just 10 pounds, even though, in reality, the bar will move \\nquite slowly. The neural drive that results from attempting to move the bar as quickly as possible will \\nrecruit more high-threshold muscle fibers.\\nPress the bar straight up or back slightly toward your head. As you press the bar up, try to rip the \\nbar apart by pulling your arms outward without changing your grip on the bar.\\nLEGS\\nAlthough the bench press is an upper-body exercise, don’t forget to use your legs. When you press \\nthe weight with your arms, you should also drive the weight with your legs to transfer more force to \\nyour upper body.\\nBREATHING\\nTake a big breath in and hold it as you lower the weight and start it on its return. This causes an \\nincrease in pressure in your chest and abdominal cavity, which better supports your body and allows \\nyour muscles to produce more force. It also expands the chest, shortening the distance the bar has \\nto travel.\\nExhale after passing the most difficult stage of the lift or after you reach the top position.\\nhormone and testosterone that accompanies the \\nsquat as compared to other exercises means it \\nenhances the strength and growth of all muscles. \\nMany great bench pressers espouse the impor -\\ntance of doing squats, if for nothing more than \\nenhancing bench press strength.\\nTo increase squat strength, the first critical \\ncomponent of any training program is the exercise \\nchoices and order. Simply stated, you have to actu-\\nally squat to increase squat strength. On workouts \\nthat emphasize squat training, the squat should be \\nthe first exercise performed. When you’re training \\nfor strength, the amount of weight you use is a \\ncritical factor for strength gains. Therefore, you \\nshould do the squat first, when the muscles are \\nnot fatigued and are at their strongest.\\nYou should follow the squat with one assistance \\nsquat or leg press exercise (such as the leg press \\nor squat machine) and occasionally an isolation \\nexercise for quadriceps (such as the leg exten -\\nsion). In addition, many weightlifters also perform \\none or two calf exercises at the end of their squat \\nworkouts. This is sensible, since the calf muscles \\nare involved during the squat.\\nTotal sets performed for squats during squat \\nworkouts should be about three to five, not includ-\\ning warm-up sets. All assistance exercises are usu-\\nally limited to three sets per exercise. Weight for \\nthe squat exercise should progressively increase \\nfrom light warm-up sets with weight around 10 to \\n50 percent RM to heavy working sets of 85 to 95 \\npercent RM. This is the range that most squat'),\n",

Because you must hold the \\nbar in the hands while driving it upward from the \\nfloor with the legs, it truly involves a majority of \\nthe body’s musculature. It is called the deadlift \\nbecause the weight is lifted from the floor. This \\neliminates the eccentric motion that precedes \\nmost exercises such as the squat and bench \\npress. The eccentric motion aids the force that \\nis produced by the muscles during the concentric \\nphase of a lift. Therefore, the deadlift is a much \\nmore difficult lift than the squat.\\nAs with the squat and bench press, to increase \\nyour strength on the deadlift, you must train the \\ndeadlift. This means that you must devote at \\nleast one workout per week to specific deadlift \\ntraining. You should perform the deadlift first \\nin the workout when the muscles are strongest \\nand not fatigued. Many powerlifters follow the \\ndeadlift exercise with assistance hamstring \\nexercises such as the Romanian deadlift or leg \\ncurl. Depending on the training split used, many \\npowerlifters also train back and sometimes \\nbiceps on deadlift day. This strategy makes \\nsense, since these muscle groups are used \\nduring the deadlift.\\nUsually about three to five sets, not including \\nwarm-up sets, are performed for the deadlift. \\nAll assistance exercises, such as the leg curl, \\nare usually limited to three sets per exercise. \\nAs with the other two strength exercises, the \\nweight on the deadlift should progressively \\nincrease from very light warm-up sets (weight \\naround 10 to 50 percent RM) to heavy working \\nsets (ranging from 85 to 95 percent RM). This \\nis the range that most lifters use in training the \\ndeadlift. However, the weight used during some \\nworkouts may go as high as 100 percent RM or \\nas low as 50 percent RM for working sets. For \\nassistance exercises, reps typically correspond \\nSTANCE\\nPlace your feet shoulder-width apart or wider—this depends on your preference. Individual bio -\\nmechanics come into play, and you must find the foot position that is most comfortable for you. \\nIf your feet are too close together, it makes it difficult for the hamstrings and glutes to properly \\nassist the quads. If your feet are too wide apart, the opposite will occur and your quads will not \\nbe able to assist. If you have long legs, going much wider than shoulder width tends to be more \\ncomfortable and more biomechanically advantageous. If you are of average height and have legs \\nthat are proportional to the length of your upper body, you will likely be comfortable with your feet \\njust slightly wider than shoulder width. If you have short legs, a shoulder-width stance will probably \\nbe most comfortable.\\nMaintain a slight bend in your knees and isometrically contract your quads, hamstrings, and glutes \\nbefore descending.\\nDESCENT\\nTo descend, stick your glutes out and descend as if you were to sit down on a chair until your thighs \\nare parallel to the floor or lower.\\nKeep your hips under the bar as much as possible to avoid excessive forward lean of your torso.\\nBe sure that your heels do not come off the floor.\\nASCENT\\nTransition from the descent to the ascent by driving forcefully upward with the legs. Concentrate on \\nmoving your hips first before your knees. As you push up, force your knees out hard and push out on \\nthe sides of your shoes while you squat. This helps to keep the tension in your hips for greater strength.\\nAs you ascend, thrust the head back. Don’t lift your chin up; just push your head back to help \\ncontract your traps.\\nBREATHING\\nTake a big breath in and hold it as you descend into the squat.\\nExhale as you pass the most difficult stage of the squat.'),\n",

The regular-stance version \\nhas the feet a little closer than shoulder-width apart, whereas the \\nsumo-stance deadlift has the feet spaced apart much wider than shoul-\\nder-width. There is no consensus that has established the clear benefits \\nof one form over the other. Therefore, the choice is pure preference \\nof the individual. Both styles are covered in the following description.\\nSETUP\\nSet up a barbell on the floor with the desired amount of weight.\\nApproach the loaded barbell until your shins are touching the bar.\\nLEGS\\nYour stance should be about as wide as your own shoulders or narrower \\nfor the regular-stance deadlift. For the sumo-stance deadlift, the feet \\nshould be much farther apart than shoulder width.\\nFor the regular-stance deadlift, toes should point straight forward or \\nslightly out (25 degrees at most). For the sumo-stance deadlift, toes \\nshould point out to about 30 to 40 degrees.\\nSquat down to a position that is similar to the bottom position of \\nthe squat. However, in the regular-stance deadlift the thighs will be \\nslightly higher than parallel to the floor. With the sumo-stance dead-\\nlift, the thighs will be about parallel to the floor. Most of your weight \\nshould be on the heels of the feet to facilitate maximal contribution \\nof the glutes and hamstrings.\\nGRIP\\nRegardless of the style used, your grip should be a staggered grip. \\nThat means one hand should be an underhand grip and the other \\nhand should be an overhand grip. This helps to prevent the bar from \\nslipping out of the hands.\\nTABLE 8.8 Day of the Deadlift\\nThis deadlift workout is for a powerlifter who has a \\nmaximum deadlift of 505 pounds and is training with \\n90 percent of his or her max.\\nExercise Sets\\nWeight \\n(pounds) Reps Rest\\nDeadlift 1 135 10* 1 min\\n1 225 10* 1 min\\n1 315 8* 2 min\\n1 365 8* 2 min\\n1 405 6* 3 min\\n1 455 4* 3 min\\n3 505 3** 4 min\\nRomanian \\ndeadlift\\n3 315 4-6** 3 min\\nLeg curl 3 180 4-6** 2 min\\n*Warm-up sets.\\n**Working sets.\\nwith the percent RM being used in that workout \\non the deadlift.

However, unlike the bodybuilder \\nwho is interested in developing the muscula -\\nture of the abdominals to chisel a well-defined \\nsix-pack, the strength athlete is interested in \\ndeveloping the strength of the abdominal mus -\\nculature. The same can be said about the low \\nback. Both the superficial and deep muscles of \\nthe abdominals and low back make up the core \\nmusculature of the body. These muscles support \\nthe shoulders, spine, and hips during all move -\\nments. Building the strength of these muscles not \\nonly helps to prevent back injuries but can help to \\nincrease strength due to the fact that the body’s \\nfoundation is stronger. For a complete listing and \\nexercise description of the abdominal and core \\nexercises, see chapter 24. For exercises of the \\nlow back, see chapter 16.\\nYou should do core, abdominal, and low-back \\nexercises toward the end of workouts to prevent \\nfatiguing of the core musculature before doing \\nthe major strength exercises with heavy weights. \\nMany powerlifters do one or two core, abdominal, \\nand low-back exercises at the end of two to four \\nworkouts per week.

However, many powerlifters train \\nthe good morning exercise with extremely heavy \\nweight and lower reps in the range of 6 to 12.

The basic workout samples provided with \\nthe training splits discussed in chapter 8 are from \\ntried-and-true training programs that work excep -\\ntionally well when the resistance used and reps \\nperformed are cycled. However, as the saying goes, \\neverything works, but nothing works forever. And \\nso, when a standard program fails to deliver the \\nstrength gains you expect, it’s time to try some -\\nthing out of the ordinary.\\nThis chapter covers strength training methods \\nthat are effective for maximizing muscle strength. \\nAs in chapter 6, the techniques are categorized by \\nthe type of acute variable of training that is being \\nmanipulated in each workout. Also as in chapter \\n6, each technique is rated on a scale of 1 to 5 for \\nfour critical areas:\\n1. Time—the amount of time that the spe -\\ncific workout typically takes to complete. \\nThis helps you immediately determine if \\nthis training technique will fit your train -\\ning schedule. The higher the number, the \\nlonger the workouts for that specific tech-\\nnique will take to complete.\\n2. Length—the amount of time required to \\nfollow the program consistently for appre-\\nciable results to be noticed. This helps you \\ndetermine if you have the patience required \\nfor a certain program to demonstrate ade-\\nquate results in strength. The higher the \\nnumber, the longer this technique must be \\nfollowed for results to be realized.\\n3. Difficulty —the amount of weightlifting \\nexperience required to use the program \\neffectively. This helps you decide if you \\nhave enough training experience to take on \\nspecific strength training techniques. The \\nhigher the number, the more training exper-\\nience you should have before attempting \\nthat particular technique.\\n4. Results—how effective the program seems \\nto be for strength gains in most people. \\nThis helps you estimate how much strength \\nyou can expect to gain with each program. \\nThe higher the number, the greater the \\ngains in strength you can expect from a \\nparticular program.\\nEach strength training method provides a \\nsample table to show how this particular tech -\\nnique can be used. Some of these tables provide \\nfull training programs complete with sample \\nworkouts to be followed over several weeks. \\nOthers provide only brief details on cycling weight \\nthroughout the program. For these you are encour-\\naged to use a basic training program, as shown \\nin chapter 8, but incorporate the weight, rep, \\nset, or rest changes as outlined in the sample \\nprogram table. Try the advanced strength train -\\ning programs discussed in chapter 9 by cycling \\nthem into your training program along with the \\nbasic programs discussed in chapter 8. These \\nadvanced programs are great to turn to when \\nyour strength gains have reached a plateau. The \\nunorthodox nature of many of these programs \\nwill offer a unique stimulus to the muscles, which \\nwill encourage strength gains. In the programs, \\nweights are given in pounds; please see appendix \\nfor metric conversions.'),\n",

It signifies how much work you are actually \\ndoing. Therefore, manipulating the work in a work-\\nout is a logical way to alter workouts in an effort to \\nboost strength. This section covers three strength \\ntraining techniques that alter the sets during \\na workout. The first method incorporates sets \\nthat are completed only when the muscle is too \\nexhausted to complete another rep. The second \\nmethod involves using a set system that is based \\non time. The third method decreases the number \\nof sets it takes to complete a set number of reps.\\nFailure Training\\nAs defined in chapter 1, muscle failure is the point \\nduring an exercise at which the muscles have fully \\nfatigued and can no longer complete an additional \\nrep of that exercise using strict form. While body-\\nbuilders tend to complete all their sets to failure, \\npowerlifters rarely, if ever, train to muscle failure. \\nIn fact, the programs in chapter 8 are not meant \\nto be used with muscle failure. Each set is done \\nfor a certain number of reps with a certain amount \\nof weight. When the number of reps prescribed for \\nthat set are completed, the set is over. In most \\ncases, you will feel as though you could have com-\\npleted at least one more rep. This is how most \\npowerlifters train to increase muscle strength. \\nMany believe that training to muscle failure can \\nhinder strength gains. However, research from \\nAustralia suggests that training to muscle failure \\nmay enhance strength gains. The key appears to \\nbe the number of sets performed to failure—and \\nthat number appears to be one.\\nAustralian researchers discovered that when \\ntrained lifters completed one set to failure of the \\nfour sets they trained with on the bench press for \\neight weeks, they had double the strength gains \\nof lifters who did not complete any of the four sets \\nto failure. And in a follow-up study, they discovered \\nthat doing more than one set to failure on the \\nbench press for eight weeks offered no additional \\nincrease in strength gains. In fact, when comparing \\nthe two studies, the strength gains reported in \\nthe study using multiple sets to failure were less \\nimpressive than the strength gains reported in the \\nstudy using just one set to failure. The reason may \\nbe that performing only one set to failure allows \\nfor enough stimulus to be delivered to the muscle \\nfibers without fatiguing the muscle too much, which \\ncan limit muscle strength during the workout when \\ntraining with too many sets to failure.\\nTaking advantage of this knowledge is rather \\nsimple. Choose any basic strength training pro -\\ngram offered in chapter 8 and be sure to perform \\nthe last set, and only the last set, of every exercise \\n(except the abdominals) to muscle failure. See \\ntable 9.1 for a sample training program that takes \\nthe last set of each exercise to failure. One caveat \\nabout training to failure is safety. For obvious \\nreasons, it is not a method to be used by those \\nwho train alone, except when done with exercises \\nthat use machines or where it is easy to return \\nthe weight to a safe location—such as the dead-\\nlift, dumbbell bench press, Smith machine squat, \\nor barbell curl. Under no circumstances should \\nanyone training alone perform any barbell pressing \\nexercises, barbell squat, leg press, or hack squat \\nto failure or close to failure. These exercises all \\nrequire the help of an adequate spotter to ensure \\nthat the last rep is done accurately and safely.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5'),\n",

Instead of a set being defined \\nby the number of reps performed, a TUT set is \\ndefined by the length of time it takes to complete \\nthe set. The time it takes to complete the set is \\nreferred to as the time the muscle is under tension. \\nTension refers to the resistance from the weight \\nbeing used. The amount of time spent doing each \\nset for an exercise can be a critical component to \\nincreasing strength. Consider a set of five reps on \\nthe bench press. If the five reps each took about \\n2 seconds to lower the weight and another 2 sec-\\nonds to press the weight back up, that’s 4 seconds \\nper rep. Five reps at this pace would take a total \\nof about 20 seconds to complete the set. In other \\nwords, the TUT for that set would be 20 seconds. If \\nthe time to complete each of those five reps were \\nincreased to 6 seconds, the TUT of that set would \\nincrease to 30 seconds. Although the number of \\nreps and the amount of weight are the same on \\neach of these sets, the first set with a TUT of 20 \\nseconds is actually better for increasing strength.\\nJust as it is well established that muscle \\nstrength is best developed by training with a rep \\nrange of 1 to 6 per set, and muscle growth is \\nbest attained with a rep range of about 8 to 12, \\nsome strength training experts believe that the \\ntotal time a set takes to complete may be just \\nas important as the number of reps completed \\nper set.

Table 9.2 shows you the \\noptimal rep range and TUT for the desired muscle \\nadaptation. The last column lists the time per rep \\nrange to complete the set within the optimal TUT .\\nRegardless of the importance of TUT for muscle \\nadaptations, no one has suggested that TUT \\nranges should replace optimal rep ranges. Instead, \\ncombining both TUT and optimal rep ranges within \\na set may be a more precise way to prescribe how \\nmuch work should be placed on a muscle to induce \\nthe desired adaptations. Using the bench press as \\nan example, if five reps (which is within the optimal \\nrep range for strength gains) were performed at \\n4 seconds per rep, the entire set would take 20 \\nseconds to complete. That set would meet both \\nthe requirements for the optimal rep range and \\noptimal TUT range to stress a muscle for maximiz-\\ning strength gains. However, training for maximal \\nstrength using TUT allows you to increase the rep \\nrange a bit beyond the optimal rep range for max-\\nimal strength, as long as the TUT range per set \\nmeets the requirements for maximal strength. This \\nallows for more variety in the training program while \\nstill staying on target for inducing strength gains.\\nTo train for maximal strength using TUT , keep \\nyour rep range at one to eight reps per set and the \\nTUT range at 4 to 20 seconds per set.

To \\nstart, you choose a weight at which you can per -\\nform about 20 reps of the exercise of choice. The \\nfirst time you go through this, it will probably take \\nyou about six to eight sets, with two-minute rest \\nperiods between sets, to complete 70 repetitions. \\nYour goal is to eventually get the 70 total repeti -\\ntions done in four sets or fewer. The benefit of this \\nmethod is that it encourages strength changes and \\nmuscle growth by altering the biochemical path -\\nways in the muscle fibers.

This section \\ncovers strength training programs that manipulate \\nthe repetitions that are performed during each set. \\nThis includes programs that alter the number of \\nreps performed per set (such as the 6 by 6 by 6 \\nsystem, 5 by 10 training, 16-week drop, 5–3–2 \\nmethod, and higher-strength program) as well as \\nprograms that manipulate the way each repetition \\nis performed (such as static strength training, \\nstronger by the inch program, ballistic training, and \\nnegative-rep training).\\n6 by 6 by 6 System\\nSimilar to the other numeral-driven programs, this \\none involves simply picking a weight that will allow \\nyou to perform six sets of six repetitions on an \\nexercise. The ideal weight will take you to failure \\nonly on the last set. Because of the higher volume \\nand intensity involved, muscle groups should not \\nbe trained more than twice per week. The benefit \\nof using this rep range is that it builds both a good \\ndeal of strength and muscle mass. The goal is to \\nincrease the weight used on each exercise by the \\nend of the six-week program. Increase the weight \\nwhen you can do more than six reps on the sixth \\nset. See table 9.5 for a sample six-week 6 by 6 \\nby 6 workout program that follows an upper- and \\nlower-body training split.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 9.5 6 by 6 by 6 Strength\\nUPPER-BODY WORKOUT 1 (MONDAY):\\nBENCH PRESS AND PUSHING EXERCISES\\nExercise Sets Reps\\nBench press 6  6\\nDumbbell bench press 6  6\\nBarbell shoulder press 6  6\\nUpright row 6  6\\nClose-grip bench press 6  6\\nDip 6  6\\nStanding crunch 6 8-10\\nLOWER-BODY WORKOUT 1 (TUESDAY):\\nSQUAT AND QUADRICEPS EXERCISES\\nSquat 6  6\\nLeg press 6  6\\nLeg extension 6  6\\nStanding calf raise 6 8-10\\nUPPER-BODY WORKOUT 2 (THURSDAY):\\nBENCH PRESS AND PULLING EXERCISES\\nBench press 6  6\\nLat pulldown 6  6\\nBarbell row 6  6\\nBarbell curl 6  6\\nRussian twist 6 20\\nLOWER-BODY WORKOUT 2 (FRIDAY):\\nDEADLIFT AND HAMSTRING EXERCISES\\nDeadlift 6  6\\nRomanian deadlift 6  6\\nLying leg curl 6  6\\nGood morning 6  6\\nSeated calf raise 6 10-12'),\n",

The 5 portion of the program \\ncomes from the 5 by 5 training method, or five sets \\nof five reps with two-minute rest periods between \\nsets. It is a method for developing strength that \\ndates to the 1950s. The goal of the 5 by 5 workout \\nis to do five sets of five reps with a given weight. On \\nyour first workout you should pick a heavy weight \\nthat allows you to get only five reps on the first \\nset and possibly five on your second. This should \\nbe about 85 percent RM for most exercises. If \\nyou can get five reps on the third set, the weight \\nyou chose was too light; you’ll need to add 5 to \\n10 pounds depending on the exercise. If, on the \\nother hand, you can’t get at least 14 total reps over \\nthe five sets, the weight you chose was too heavy; \\nyou’ll need to drop about 5 to 10 pounds. When \\nyou find the right weight for the exercise, stay with \\nthat weight over the course of this workout until \\nyou can do all five sets for five reps. Then you’ll \\nstart over and increase the weight again to one \\nthat allows you to get only five reps on the first set. \\nDo this on two exercises for each muscle group \\n(for example, bench press and incline dumbbell \\nbench press, squat and leg press, and deadlift \\nand Romanian deadlift). For all other exercises \\nthat follow in that workout, do three sets of five \\nto seven reps (except for calf and ab exercises, \\nwhich can be done at higher reps).\\nThe 10 portion of the 5 by 10 program comes \\nfrom the 10 by 10 program used in this workout \\nscheme. The goal is to perform 10 sets of 10 reps \\nwith a given weight. The reason this is included \\nin a strength program is to stimulate the muscle \\nfibers with a different stimulus in each workout. \\nThe schemes of the 5 by 5 and the 10 by 10 are \\nsimilar, but different weights, reps, and total sets \\nare used for each. This cycling of weight, reps, \\nand sets prevents the muscle fibers from stag -\\nnating in the program, and therefore it enhances \\nmuscle adaptation.\\nFor the 10 by 10 training, do 10 sets of 10 reps \\nwith just one exercise per workout and follow it with \\nthree sets of 8 to 10 reps on all the subsequent \\nassistance exercises for that workout (except \\nfor calf and ab exercises, which can be done at \\nhigher reps). For the 10 by 10 training, choose a \\nweight that you can normally get for about 12 to \\n15 reps. This should be about 65 to 70 percent \\nRM for most exercises. The first few sets will feel \\nvery light. This will serve as a thorough warm-up. \\nPerform these early sets with explosive power on \\neach rep to recruit more of the fast-twitch muscle \\nfibers that are capable of greater gains in strength \\nand power. As the sets continue, the fatigue will \\nstart to set in and the number of reps will fall \\ndrastically. As with the 5 by 5 program, once you \\ncan complete 10 sets of 10 reps, you increase the \\nweight again and start over.\\nBecause you will reach failure several times on \\neach workout, you should train each muscle group \\nonly once per week, such as with the squat–bench \\npress–deadlift training split. This split is used in \\nthe sample 5 by 10 program outline in table 9.6. \\nSimply follow this split and alternate the weight, \\nreps, and sets every other week. You’ll likely reach \\nthe 5 by 5 goal first. Increase the weight again and \\ncontinue progressing until you reach the 10 by 10 \\ngoal or eight weeks have passed. Then switch over \\nto a more basic training scheme.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\n5 by 10 Training'),\n",

The 16-week drop \\nis a great program for beginner and intermediate \\nweightlifters who are interested in peaking maximal \\nstrength. Because it starts with lighter weight and \\nhigher reps and slowly increases the weight while \\ndecreasing the reps over the 16 weeks, it allows \\nthe beginner enough time to work with higher \\nreps and lower intensities before jumping into the \\nheavy-weight and low-rep training that is required \\nto boost maximal strength. It works well with any \\ntraining split, including a whole-body strength \\ntraining split. This program starts with sets of 12 \\nreps with a weight that is about 70 percent RM \\nfor three weeks. Then the reps drop to 10 per set \\nwith a weight increase to about 75 percent RM \\nfor the next three weeks. Next the weight bumps \\nup to 80 percent RM and the reps drop to 8 per \\nset for the next three weeks. Following that, the \\nweight increases again to 85 percent RM and reps \\ndrop to five per set for the next three weeks. This \\nis followed by a bump in weight to 90 percent RM \\nand a corresponding drop in reps to four per set \\nfor three more weeks. And finally, the last week \\nis associated with an increase in weight to 95 \\npercent RM as reps drop down to two per set. \\nOne-rep max testing on all three exercises can be \\ndone after this final week of training.

You finish with two weeks \\nof training with a weight that allows you to get \\nonly two sets of two reps, or a 2 by 2 program. \\nSimilar to other weight progression schemes for \\nincreasing strength, this program works because \\nit slowly increases the weight until a weight close \\nto the one-rep max is being used.

They studied leg strength in subjects on a \\n10-week program of leg presses and leg exten -\\nsions. One group trained with five sets of three \\nto five reps while the second group added one \\nset of 25 to 30 reps at the end of each exercise. \\nThe group that added the 25 to 30 reps had a 5 \\npercent greater increase in strength, as well as \\ngreater increases in muscle size, than the group \\nperforming just five sets of 3 to 5 reps. Although \\nthe scientists were unsure of the exact mecha -\\nnism for the additional strength gains, it appears \\nthat the single set of higher reps provides an \\nadditional training stimulus that affects strength \\ngains. The higher levels of growth hormone \\nassociated with the higher-rep training may have \\naffected adaptations in muscle fibers that could \\nhave increased the strength of the muscle fibers. \\nTaking advantage of this information is as simple \\nas adding one set of 25 to 30 reps with a weight \\nthat is only about 45 to 50 percent RM to a pro -\\ngram that incorporates a 5 by 5 strength training \\nsystem. Be sure to take this final set to muscle \\nfailure. Since this program is fairly demanding on \\nthe muscle fibers, you should train each muscle \\ngroup just once per week while using this program \\nin table 9.9. Follow it for no more than eight weeks.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 9.8 5–3–2 Strength Program (continued)\\n1Thursday perform bench press and incline dumbbell press before \\nsquat.\\n2Thursday perform seated calf raise.\\n3Friday perform hanging leg raise.\\n4Friday perform Russian twist.\\n5Friday perform dumbbell woodchopper.'),\n",

Although using a full range of motion \\n(ROM) is typically a smart thing to do, there are \\noccasions when going against the norm is war -\\nranted, such as when strength gains have come to \\na halt regardless of the programs you have tried. \\nWhen this is the case, it’s time to pull out all the \\nstops and use something quite unorthodox—such \\nas static strength training. The term \\nstatic means \\nlack of movement, as in an isometric contraction. \\nAnd as this term implies, with static training you \\ntake a weight and hold it in a fixed position for \\nseveral seconds. This concept is based on the idea \\nthat by forcing the muscle to work only when it is \\nmaximally contracted and using the heaviest weight \\npossible, you can optimize its strength potential.\\nAlthough there is no published research to sup-\\nport its effectiveness, anecdotal reports on static \\nstrength training are quite impressive. In fact, Bob \\nHoffman, founder of the York Barbell Company \\nand former U.S. Olympic weightlifting coach, had \\nmembers of the U.S. team use a similar training \\nsystem with much success in the early 1960s. The \\nlate Mike Mentzer, professional bodybuilder, also \\ntouted the effectiveness of static contractions for \\nbuilding both muscle size and strength. It appears \\nto work because of the overload that is placed on \\nthe muscle. When you train using a full ROM, the \\namount of weight you can use is limited by your \\nsticking point—the point in the exercise ROM where \\nyou’re weakest. You can use only as much weight as \\nyou can lift through that sticking point. With static \\ncontractions, the sticking point is eliminated, so \\nyou can overload the muscle fibers with as much \\nweight as you can hold for at least 10 seconds in \\nthe strongest position of the particular muscle.\\nTo use static strength training properly, be sure \\nto start each workout with a thorough warm-up. \\nDo two light sets of each exercise you’re training \\nstatically. On each rep, stop and hold for a count \\nof three at about two to four inches from the end \\nof the full contraction.

Do two static sets per exer-\\ncise with two minutes of rest in between sets. The \\nweight you choose should be light enough to allow \\nyou to hold it statically at about two to four inches \\nfrom the full contraction point of the movement for \\nat least 10 seconds but heavy enough so that you \\ncan’t hold it for more than 20 seconds. See the \\nfollowing sample photos of static contraction hold \\npositions for common exercises. Once you can hold \\na weight for more than 20 seconds, it’s time to \\nincrease the weight. After the second set, drop the \\nweight and do three full-ROM sets of that exercise.\\nYou’ll need a reliable training partner to help you \\nwith this training method. Your training partner will \\nneed to help you move the weight to the static posi-\\ntion but should apply only enough force as needed \\nto help you get the weight there. That will help to \\nprepare your muscles to resist the weight during the \\nstatic contraction. The training partner should also \\nwatch the clock during your static sets to make sure \\nyou are within the time window of 10 to 20 seconds \\nper set. A Smith machine makes a good tool to use \\nfor many of the static contraction exercises because \\nit is easier to set the weight in the correct position.\\nTry the static strength training program outlined \\nin table 9.10 for eight weeks before returning to \\nfull-ROM training. The goal is to progress to heavier \\nweights for the static contraction sets over the \\neight weeks. This should carry over to greater \\nstrength when you return to full-ROM training.

This is the \\nnew weight with which you’ll finish the program. The \\ngoal is to lower the weight an additional two inches \\neach week until you’re about four inches above the \\nbottom position. If you don’t progress to this point \\nby eight weeks, stop where you are and test your \\n1RM. You should still show some improvement on \\nyour strength in the full ROM for that lift.\\nThis method of progressive partials works \\nbecause of overload. By using a weight that’s \\nheavier than you could normally handle for full-\\nrange reps, you overload the majority of the muscle \\nfibers that perform the full-ROM version of the \\nexercise. Although your strength increase will be \\nmainly in the small ROM you’re using, some of this \\nwill carry over into the lower portions of the ROM. \\nBy slowly lowering the ROM in two-inch increments, \\nyou allow the muscle fibers to adapt to the heavier \\nweight and slowly increase the ROM to which your \\nnew strength can be applied.\\nTable 9.11 shows a sample bench press pro -\\ngram set up for a lifter with an 18-inch range of \\nmotion and a 275-pound 1RM using 300 as his \\nor her new weight.

This weight is performed for \\npartial-ROM reps that gradually increase in ROM \\nuntil the full ROM is completed. It is a method \\nto use sparingly, such as when all other strength \\ntraining methods have failed to provide sufficient \\ngains in strength. This method of using progres -\\nsive partial reps to grow stronger works best for \\ncompound movements such as the three major \\nstrength lifts: bench press, squat, and deadlift. \\nTo \\nfollow the stronger by the inch program safely and \\neffectively, you should perform the lifts in a power \\nrack. This allows you to accurately measure the ROM \\nand keep it limited to where you want it. The pins \\nwill also act as a safety net for when you fail. See \\nthe Rack It Up box for setting up properly in the rack.\\nYou start the program with about 10 percent \\nmore weight than your current one-rep max (1RM) \\nfor the lift on which you wish to increase your \\nstrength.

The distance \\nwill probably range from 12 to 24 inches (30.5 to 61 centimeters), depending on your \\nlimb length and the exercise you’re doing. Therefore, the number of pin settings will likely \\nrange from 2 to 10 holes. Your progression scheme will be based partly on this number.\\n •Subtract 4 inches from the top, meaning you won’t use the first one or two pin settings.\\n •Subtract 4 inches from the bottom, meaning you won’t work below 4 inches from the bottom \\nposition. (Once you’re close to this point, you’ll likely be able to perform a full rep with the \\nweight.) In other words, you won’t work down to the last one or two pegs.\\n •Now count the number of pin settings between these two settings. This should be some-\\nwhere from one to seven holes.\\n •If the rack you’re using has setting increments larger than 2 inches, you’ll need to modify \\nit so that you make 2-inch progressions over the course of the program.

This is because each \\nstrength exercise has a natural biomechanical \\nsticking point that occurs at a spot in the range of \\nmotion where primary muscle groups are changing. \\nFor example, in the bench press, the sticking point \\nfor many lifters is where the primary force is being \\nchanged from the pectoralis major to the deltoids \\nand triceps. Ballistic training uses explosive move-\\nments that power you through these sticking points.\\nThe major benefit of ballistic training has to \\ndo with acceleration. In a traditional rep, you \\ntypically accelerate the weight on the concentric \\nportion only during the first third of the range of \\nmotion. During the other two-thirds, the weight is \\nactually being decelerated. If deceleration did not \\ntake place, you wouldn’t be able to hold onto the \\nweight at the end of the rep. Yet, when you train \\nballistically, the weight is accelerated through the \\nwhole range of motion and starts to decelerate \\nonly after you’ve let go of the bar. This allows you \\nto develop much more power through the rep.\\nBallistic training also forces your body to trig -\\nger fast-twitch muscle fibers. This is important \\nbecause these fibers have the greatest potential \\nfor strength gains. Because ballistic training forces \\nthe muscles to adapt to contracting very quickly \\nand forcefully, it trains the fast-twitch fibers to \\nproduce a great amount of force in a very short \\nperiod. This is very useful when applying a great \\namount of force such as during a max bench press, \\nsquat, or deadlift.\\nBallistic training is most commonly performed \\nwith bench press throws and squat jumps, often \\nusing a Smith machine, which guides the bar \\nsecurely along metal rods. Yet, ballistic training is \\nnot confined to these exercises. In fact, ballistic \\ntraining can be done for almost any muscle group. \\nSee table 9.13 for a list of ballistic exercises that \\ncan be performed in any gym.\\nRegardless of the exercise, ballistic training \\nshould be done with a weight that is about 30 to 50 \\npercent of the 1RM for that exercise. This weight \\nis used because research has shown that opti -\\nmal power is produced at about 30 to 50 percent \\nRM. For example, if your max bench press is 300 \\npounds, you would do bench press throws on the \\nSmith machine with about 90 to 150 pounds. The \\nnumber of reps performed with ballistic training is \\nthree to five reps, never any more. This is to keep \\nevery rep a max effort and prevent fatigue. Fatigue \\ndoes not benefit the development of power and can \\nactually increase the risk of injury when training \\nballistically. Therefore, rest time should be ample \\nbetween sets. Take at least three minutes of rest \\nbefore doing another set.\\nA great way to work ballistic training into your \\nregimen is to use a max effort–dynamic effort train-\\ning split and perform the ballistic training during \\nthe dynamic effort portion of the split. An example \\nof this is outlined in table 9.14 to be done on the \\nthird and fourth workouts (usually on Thursday \\nand Friday) of a max effort–dynamic effort training \\nsplit. Another way to train ballistically is to follow a \\nsquat, bench press, and deadlift training split on \\na full-body ballistic workout performed on a fourth \\nday. An example of such a workout is presented \\nin table 9.15.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nBallistic Strength Training'),\n",

Unlike negative-rep training to build muscle \\nmass, negative-rep strength training does not \\ncome as an afterthought at the end of a workout \\nbut as the first and foremost method used in the \\nworkout. Doing negative reps as the first sets of an \\nexercise allows for greater than 100 percent RM \\nto be used as weight. Most lifters can resist about \\n130 percent of their 1RM on the negative portion \\nof the rep. Training with this much weight even on \\nthe negative motion of an exercise can cause real \\nstrength gains on the positive portion of the exer-\\ncise as well. This has to do with muscle fiber and \\nnerve adaptations. The overload that the excess \\nweight places on the muscle fiber induces muscle \\ndamage and influences the nerves that cause the \\nmuscles to recruit more fast-twitch muscle fibers. \\nThese two factors result in muscle regeneration that \\nleads to larger and stronger muscle fibers as well \\nas a greater number of fast-twitch muscle fibers.\\nWhen training with negative reps, the key is \\nto perform the rep slowly. You should attempt a \\nweight that is about 130 percent of your 1RM for \\nthe exercises you are training and resist it at a rate \\nthat takes three to five seconds to complete the \\nnegative rep. If you can resist the weight for longer \\nthan five seconds, add more weight. If you can’t \\nresist the weight for at least three seconds, reduce \\nthe weight. Perform three sets of four to six nega-\\ntive reps for each major lift—bench press, squats \\n(should be done on Smith machine), and deadlift. \\nFollow the negatives with two sets of regular reps \\nusing a weight that is about 75 to 80 percent RM.\\nBecause of the intensity of negative-rep training, \\nyou’ll need more time to recover between sets, \\nat least three minutes. The same holds true for \\nrecovery between workouts, because you should \\nallow a full seven days of rest between workouts. \\nThat makes the squat–bench press–deadlift train-\\ning split a popular one to use when training with \\nnegative-rep training. See table 9.16 for a sample \\nnegative-rep training week using that split. Follow \\nthis for no more than six weeks.\\nTo use negative-rep training safely and effec -\\ntively, you should have the help of a training \\npartner. Those who train alone can do unilateral \\nnegatives with the help of a Smith machine. To do \\nthis, load the Smith machine with about 70 percent \\nRM for the bench press, squat, or deadlift.

Switch the limb \\nthat takes the negative rep every other rep until \\neach limb has performed four to six negative reps.\\nFinally, you should be aware of delayed-onset \\nmuscle soreness (DOMS) that usually accompanies \\nnegative-rep training. For those unaccustomed to \\nnegative-rep training, DOMS can be severe. The \\nmore often you use the technique, the less severe \\nthe soreness will be. Some people may be at risk \\nfor developing a rare condition known as rhabdo-\\nmyolysis. This sometimes-fatal condition can occur \\nafter severe muscle damage.

This can \\nescalate into dangerously high blood potassium \\nlevels and may result in heart failure.

The amount of weight \\nyou can lift defines your level of strength. Because \\nof this, it is only logical that strength training pro-\\ngrams that vary the weight you lift are successful \\nstrategies for building muscle strength. This \\nsection discusses strength training techniques \\nthat alter the load, or amount of weight, used \\nduring workouts. Some techniques work through \\nmechanisms involving the nervous system, such \\nas the max-out for muscle strength method and \\nwave training method. The 5 percent method works \\nby systematically increasing and decreasing the \\nweight over time, while the DeLorme ascending \\npyramid progressively increases the weight on \\neach successive set. One program—the same-\\nweight training method—uses the same weight \\nfor all sets. Modifying the weight you train with \\nby following any of these programs will work to \\nincrease the total amount of weight you can lift.'),\n",

This refers to the ability of one \\nexercise to immediately enhance the performance \\nof a second exercise that is performed shortly after \\nthe first exercise. Although there are many ways to \\ndo this, the max-out for muscle strength method \\nuses the same exercise but different weights \\nto achieve the same effect. More precisely, this \\nmethod uses a one-rep set with 90 percent RM to \\nenhance the number of reps that can be performed \\nwith a subsequent set using 80 percent RM.\\nAlthough the exact mechanism for this phenom-\\nenon has not been pinpointed, scientists currently \\nbelieve that it may be due to enhanced excitation of \\nthe central nervous system or to molecular events \\nin the muscle fibers themselves. In simpler terms, \\nperforming the heavy set “tricks” your nervous \\nsystem into preparing for another heavy set. When \\nyou suddenly drop the weight, it feels lighter than \\nit normally would because your nervous system is \\ncalling in more muscle fibers to do the job than it \\nnormally would for the lighter weight. This is the \\nreason baseball players swing with a weighted bat \\nbefore hitting with a much lighter bat. Regardless \\nof the mechanism, the bottom line is that it may \\nincrease your strength on lighter sets by close to \\n10 percent.\\nTo perform this method in the gym, you do one \\nset using 90 to 95 percent RM for just one rep. \\nThen you rest three minutes and perform a set \\nwith about 10 percent more than 80 percent RM \\n(a weight you can normally lift for about eight reps). \\nThe potentiation from the previous set should \\nallow you to complete about eight reps with the \\nheavier weight. For example, if your 1RM on the \\nbench press is 300, the first set you do (after two \\nor three warm-up sets) is for one rep with about \\n275 to 285 pounds. The second set you do would \\nbe with 260 pounds for about eight reps. Normally \\nyou would be able to lift only 240 pounds for eight \\nreps, but the potentiation increased your strength \\nby roughly 10 percent.\\nThe best way to use this technique is to reserve \\nit for major lifts and train those lifts just once per \\nweek. Do not use the max-out for muscle strength \\ntechnique for more than eight weeks consecutively \\nfor any exercise.

Basically, in each \\nworkout the weight lifted is increased by about \\n5 percent and the number of reps performed is \\ndecreased by one. Although the 5 percent program \\nis a little more complicated than that, the result is \\nsimply an increase in strength of about 10 percent \\nafter only six successive workouts. The 5 percent \\nprogram is best used on basic exercises such \\nas the bench press, incline bench press, squat, \\ndeadlift, leg press, shoulder press, barbell row, \\nand pulldown. It can also be adapted to basic arm \\nexercises such as close-grip bench press, triceps \\npressdown, triceps extension, and the barbell curl. \\nPerform no more than three exercises per muscle \\ngroup and provide each with five to seven days of \\nrest between workouts. To start the 5 percent pro-\\ngram, pick a weight for each exercise that allows \\nyou to perform four sets of six reps with three- to \\nfour-minute rest periods between sets. We’ll use \\nthe squat, with a weight of 300 pounds, as an \\nexample. In workout 1 you would perform four sets \\nof the squat, each for six reps using 300 pounds. \\nFor workout 2 you increase the weight by 5 per -\\ncent—or to 315 pounds—and finish four sets of \\nfive reps. At workout 3 you increase the weight by \\n5 percent again (from the original 300 pounds)—or \\n330 pounds—and do four sets of four reps. Work-\\nout 4 has a slight change. Here you drop 5 percent \\nof the weight from the previous workout—back to \\n315 pounds—but you do four sets of six reps. \\nAt workout 5 you bump up the weight again by 5 \\npercent to 330 pounds and do four sets of five \\nreps. In workout six you increase the weight again \\nby 5 percent—or 345 pounds—and do four sets \\nof four reps. During the next workout, you should \\nbe able to get four sets of six reps using 330 \\npounds—a nice 10 percent increase in strength. \\nSee table 9.18 for a sample leg workout using the \\n5 percent method.

The key is \\nstarting with a weight at which you can get more \\nrepetitions than you will perform. For example, \\nyou should start with a weight at which you can \\nget seven or eight reps on your exercise of choice \\n(about 80 percent RM), but you’d perform only \\nsix reps.

This is due \\nto the small progressions in weight that take place \\nwith each wave. The waves actually allow you to \\nlift up to 102 percent of your current max right off \\nthe bat. While that may equate to only a few extra \\npounds, over six to eight weeks the total expected \\nstrength boost is somewhere around 10 percent.\\nFor this program, you’ll perform a few warm-up \\nsets, then two or three waves of three sets each, \\nwith four minutes of rest between waves and \\nbetween each set. During wave 1, your first set \\nwill consist of three reps with 90 percent RM (a \\nweight you can normally lift for about four reps). \\nSet 2 consists of two reps with 95 percent RM. \\nAnd on set 3, you’ll do one rep with 100 percent \\nRM. On wave 2 you’ll increase the weight used \\non each set by about 1 percent. In other words, \\nset 1 will be about 91 percent RM, set 2 will be \\n96 percent RM, and set 3 will be 101 percent \\nRM. Because this increment is so small and the \\nsmallest Olympic plates are 1.25 pounds, this \\nwill equal a 2.5-pound jump on any weight under \\n400 pounds. For weights of 400 pounds or more, \\nadd 5 pounds. In either case, on the third set of \\nwave 2, you’ll be lifting more than your current \\nmax. If you’re up for it, go for a third wave. To do \\nso, simply increase the weight another 1 percent \\nfor each set and go for the same number of reps \\non each set. That means 102 percent of your max \\non that third set.\\nThe goal of wave training is to increase the \\nweight used on each wave by 1 to 2 percent every \\nworkout. Bit by bit, you can notch up your overall \\nstrength. But if you aren’t successful completing \\nthe last set of the last wave of a workout, start \\nthe next workout with the same weights you used \\nthe previous time and really push to break through \\non this round. Then you can raise the weight on \\nthe next workout.\\nThe reason wave training works has to do with \\npotentiation—similar to the potentiation discussed \\nin the max-out for muscle strength method. The \\nearlier sets prime the nervous system, or the con-\\ntractile fibers of the muscle, in such a way that the \\nmuscle is able to contract with more force on later \\nsets. As most of the strength techniques suggest, \\nreserve this strength training method for the prime \\nstrength movements or the exercises you substi-\\ntute for them. Follow the wave training with three \\nsets of four to six reps on assistance exercises.\\nBecause of the high intensity of this program, \\nyou shouldn’t train each major lift or muscle group \\nmore than once per week. Therefore, the squat–\\nbench press–deadlift training split is ideal to use \\nwith wave training. See table 9.20 for a sample \\nwave training deadlift program, set up for a person \\nwho can currently deadlift 405 pounds for one rep \\nand wants to get up to 445 pounds.

On set 2 you perform \\n10 reps with 75 percent of your 10RM. On set 3 \\nyou perform 10 reps (or as many reps as it takes \\nto reach failure) with the actual 10RM. The first \\ntwo sets function as warm-up sets because the \\nweight is relatively light given the number of reps \\nyou have to perform. It is just the last set that can \\nbe considered a working set.\\nAlthough this method may seem like little work \\nto many lifters, this one-working-set scheme may \\nbe the reason it works so well to increase strength. \\nIt provides a thorough warm-up and allows only one \\nset to failure.

Most lifters rest a full three \\nminutes between sets and rarely veer from this \\nstandard. However, altering rest periods can have a \\nsignificant impact on strength gains when properly \\nexecuted. This section covers strength training \\nprograms that systematically alter the rest peri -\\nods involved. This can be done by implementing \\nshort rest periods between each rep (as with the \\nrest–pause technique), by progressively lowering \\nthe rest between sets every week (as with one-rep \\nto one-set method), or by progressively losing rest \\ntime between sets because of an increase in the \\nnumber of reps performed each week (as found \\nin the density training technique).\\nRest–Pause Technique\\nRest–pause is a lifting technique that involves \\nstopping during a set, resting for a short period, \\nand then continuing with the set. Its major advan-\\ntage is that it allows for more total reps to be \\ndone with a given weight. That’s because it takes \\nadvantage of the muscles’ ability to recover rap -\\nidly. In simple terms, it allows the muscles time \\nto replenish phosphocreatine (PCr)—the same \\nmolecule that creatine supplements boost. With \\nthis shot of extra energy, the muscle can contract \\nmore strongly, producing greater force and getting \\nmore reps. The greater the force your muscle can \\nproduce and the more reps you can perform, the \\ngreater the stimulus the muscles receive and the \\ngreater the gains in strength that you can expect.\\nThe concept behind rest–pause training for \\nstrength gains is not necessarily to get more \\ntotal reps or reach a higher state of fatigue but to \\noptimize the force produced on each rep. To prior-\\nitize strength gains with rest–pause, you typically \\nuse a weight that allows you to get only three to \\nfive reps (3- to 5RM). The most common form of \\nrest–pause training is to choose a weight that you \\ncan perform at only about three reps. Do one rep \\nand rack the weight. Rest 15 seconds and then \\npump out another rep. Repeat this process until \\nyou have completed three to five reps total. That \\nconcludes one rest–pause set. This technique has \\nbeen shown to be effective at producing decent \\nstrength gains, but it may not be the most effective.\\nIn the laboratory it was discovered that an even \\nbetter rest–pause technique for building strength \\ninvolved shorter rest periods—about 3 to 5 sec -\\nonds. Instead of racking the weight and resting 15 \\nseconds between each rep, you simply hold the \\nweight and rest for 3 to 5 seconds then complete \\nanother rep. Do this for a total of three reps. Stop-\\nping at three reps allows you to do three sets at \\nthe same weight, which maximizes the stimulus \\nthe muscle receives. Rest–pause training can work \\nwith any training split. To get appreciable results \\nfrom rest–pause training, you will need to use it \\nconsistently for four to six weeks.\\nTable 9.22 gives a sample bench press routine. \\nDo all three sets using this rest–pause technique \\nand then follow them up with a second exercise \\nfor chest (such as incline bench press or dumbbell \\nbench press) for another three sets of rest–pause. \\nYou will find that you can use considerably more \\nweight than usual on the second exercise because \\nyou will not be as fatigued as you would be with \\nthree regular sets.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 9.22 A Pause for Strength\\nExercise Weight Set Reps Rest Comments\\nBench press 260 1, 2, 3 1, 1, 1 3 min Do 3 reps total, each separated by 5 seconds of rest in \\ntop position.'),\n",

Doing 10 \\nsets of one rep with the same weight each set is \\nthe same amount of work as one set of 10 reps \\nwith that same weight. The difference is that doing \\nthe work as a single set is harder because of the \\nfatigue that sets in—partly from the increasing \\nlevels of lactic acid. If you slowly, over time, reduce \\nthe amount of rest between those 10 sets, you \\nwill train the muscle to be better at producing the \\nquick energy you need and to deal with the lactic \\nacid—and this obviously will help the muscles grow \\nstronger. The best way to go about this is to start \\nwith a weight at which you can do 10 sets of one \\nrep with 90-second rest periods between sets. You \\nthen attempt to shave 15 seconds off of the rest \\nperiods with each successive workout.\\nHow this works is simple: Consider that you \\ncan lift the weight for 10 reps—just not 10 reps \\nin a row.

This is partic-\\nularly good for increasing strength on body-weight \\nexercises, such as pull-ups, dips, and push-ups \\n(since you can’t change your body weight easily), \\nbut it can be used for any exercise. Density training \\nbegins by doubling the volume of work you want \\nto accomplish. If your goal is to complete 12 reps \\nwith a certain amount of weight, then you start off \\nwith 12 sets of 2 reps (or 24 total reps) in 12 min-\\nutes. So rest is about 50 seconds between sets. \\nBasically you have 1 minute to complete each set \\nand rest before the next set. The more reps you \\ndo each set, the less rest you are allowed. After \\nthis becomes easy, move to 8 sets of 3 reps in 8 \\nminutes. When this becomes easy, move to 6 sets \\nof 4 reps in 6 minutes, then 5 sets of 5 reps in 5 \\nminutes, then 4 sets of 6 reps in 4 minutes. When \\nthis becomes easy, move to 3 sets of 8 reps in 3 \\nminutes. When you’ve mastered this, you should \\nbe able to get 1 set of 12 straight reps. By per -\\nforming the same overall amount of work (24 reps) \\nand progressively decreasing the amount of rest \\ntime, you are increasing the amount of work done \\nduring a given amount of time or increasing the \\ndensity of the work.

Using the proper \\nexercises can make a huge difference in your \\nstrength gains. This section discusses strength \\ntraining methods that alter the exercises that are \\nused to increase muscle strength. Some of these \\ntechniques focus solely on specific types of exer-\\ncises, such as unilateral training and the dumbbell \\npower program, while others use specific types of \\nexercises in a particular order, such as the three-\\nstep strength method, front-to-back training, and \\nECO training method.\\nUnilateral Training\\nUnilateral training refers to training one side of the \\nbody at a time. Unlike one-sided training for build-\\ning muscle mass (covered in chapter 6), unilateral \\ntraining does not separate training days into left- \\nand right-side workouts. Unilateral training simply \\nuses exercises that are performed with one limb \\nat a time—such as the one-arm dumbbell bench \\npress, the one-leg squat, and even the one-leg, \\none-arm dumbbell deadlift. Although this approach \\nto training is nothing revolutionary, few power -\\nlifters actually train using unilateral exercises. \\nThis is unfortunate, since research confirms that \\nwhen you train unilaterally the muscles are able \\nto produce more force, and more muscle fibers \\n(particularly fast-twitch muscle fibers) are active. \\nOne study comparing unilateral biceps curls to \\nbilateral (both arms) biceps curls reported that the \\nforce produced on bilateral biceps curls was up to \\nabout 20 percent less than the sum of the force \\nproduced from the left- and right-arm unilateral \\ncurls. In other words, if you could curl 100 pounds \\nwith a barbell for one rep, you would expect to be \\nable to curl only a 50-pound dumbbell with each \\narm for one rep. In reality, you may be able to curl \\na 60-pound dumbbell with each arm for one rep. \\nAdding the weight of those dumbbells together \\nwould mean that you could curl a total of 120 \\npounds, or 20 percent more than with both arms \\nat the same time.\\nTo take advantage of the added strength that \\nunilateral training offers, you should periodically do \\none-arm and one-leg exercises. See table 9.25 for \\na list of one-arm and one-leg exercises that can be \\nadded to a strength training program. Descriptions \\nof how to perform these exercises correctly are \\nfound in part V . A great way to incorporate these \\nexercises into your current strength training pro -\\ngram is to include two sets of unilateral versions \\nof the strength lifts after you have completed the \\nworking sets of the strength lifts.

While \\none benefit of this training method is the variety of \\nexercises, the main benefit stems from the order \\nin which you do these exercises. The major reason \\nfor this has to do with the stabilizer muscles.\\nThe stabilizer muscles generally lie deep under \\nyour major muscle groups (the prime movers). \\nThough the stabilizers are often much smaller and \\nweaker, they’re important for securing the joints \\nduring various movements. When you train with \\nequipment that’s fairly unstable—such as dumb-\\nbells—the stabilizer muscles become fatigued \\nmuch sooner than the muscle group you’re trying \\nto work because the stabilizers are weaker. When \\nthe stabilizers are fatigued, the brain limits the \\nnervous input to the prime movers in order to \\nprevent injury from occurring. In other words, the \\nstabilizers limit the amount of force the prime \\nmovers can produce.\\nOne unorthodox way to train that prevents the \\nstabilizers from being the weak link in your training \\nis to order your exercises in a manner that moves \\nfrom the least stable exercise to the most stable. \\nThis way, as the stabilizer muscles fatigue, you \\nchange the exercises to ones that require less \\nactivity of the stabilizers. This allows the prime \\nmovers to train with heavy weights that are not \\nlimited by the fatigue of the stabilizer muscles. \\nThe three-step strength method follows this order \\nby starting the workout with dumbbell exercises, \\nwhich require the most help from the stabilizers \\nbecause each arm is allowed to move in all direc-\\ntions that the joints will allow. For leg exercises, \\none-leg exercises would take the place of dumbbell \\nexercises. The workout then moves to a barbell \\nexercise. Because it is a free-weight exercise, you \\nstill require some use of stabilizer muscles. But \\nbecause these exercises are done bilaterally with \\nboth arms locked in place on the bar (upper-body \\nexercises) or both legs locked in place on the floor \\n(leg exercises), there is less use of the stabilizers \\nthan with dumbbell or unilateral leg exercises. \\nThe last type of exercise on the list is a machine \\nexercise. This type of exercise requires barely any \\nhelp from the stabilizers because the movement \\nof the machine forces your body to follow a prede-\\ntermined path that doesn’t permit deviation. Since \\nthe machine is designed to target particular prime \\nmovers, the stabilizers are basically not needed.\\nAs an example of a three-step strength method \\nworkout for a bench press-focused workout, you \\nwould start with the dumbbell bench press, then \\nmove to the barbell bench press, and finish with \\nthe machine bench press. For a squat-focused \\nworkout, you could start with the one-leg squat as \\nthe first exercise, then move to the barbell squat as \\nthe second exercise, and finish with the leg press. \\nUsing this training method for a deadlift-focused \\nworkout is not ideal but can be done. For this \\nworkout, start with the one-leg, one-arm dumbbell \\ndeadlift, then move to the standard deadlift, and \\nfinish with a horizontal leg press machine (but \\nstart the movement from the down position, which \\nmimics the deadlift).\\nThis training method should not take the place \\nof standard strength training methods that orga -\\nnize the major strength exercises first in the work-\\nout. Instead, the best way to use the three-step \\nstrength method is to train with it on a second \\nworkout for that lift later in the week. For instance, \\nyou can do a standard bench press workout early in \\nthe week and then do a three-step strength method \\nbench press workout later in the week. This works \\nwell with the squat–bench press–deadlift training \\nsplit by adding a three-step strength method work-\\nout on Saturday. An example of this is shown in \\nthe workout in table 9.27. Each exercise should \\nbe done for 3 working sets. The amount of weight \\nused and the reps performed can be cycled to \\ncorrespond with your training phase.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nThree-Step Strength Method'),\n",

Training this way is not \\nany more beneficial than using barbells, but it can \\nwork to pull you out of a training slump and get your \\nstrength gains climbing again for several reasons. \\nThe first reason is the change. Changing your train-\\ning with different exercises, such as those found \\nin the dumbbell power program, can affect your \\noverall strength by recruiting different muscle fibers \\nthat you may have neglected from doing the usual \\nexercises in your routine. Then there’s the strength \\nimbalance that most lifters have. Some experience \\nup to a 10 percent difference between their stron-\\nger side and weaker side. Unilateral training with \\ndumbbells forces the weaker side to gain strength \\nsince that side must lift the dumbbell on its own.\\nAnother benefit of dumbbells is that they can \\nimprove the strength of your stabilizer muscles. \\nThis can actually enhance overall muscle strength \\nwhile reducing the risk of injury to your joints. \\nDumbbell strength training is also great for those \\nwho train at home. Dumbbells take up little room, \\nand you can perform a variety of exercises in a \\nminimal amount of space. These exercises are \\nalso great for those with shoulder, elbow, or wrist \\ninjuries because they allow a freer ROM compared \\nto the ROM allowed with barbells.\\nThe dumbbell power program is a six-week \\nprogram that involves many multijoint and \\nmultimovement exercises that increase overall \\nbody strength. See table 9.28 for the outline of \\nthe program. Detailed descriptions on how to \\nperform these exercises can be found in part V . \\nEach workout is done three days per week—usually \\nMonday, Wednesday, and Friday. If you want, you \\ncan include one extra training day that hits the \\nsquat, bench press, and deadlift. In weeks 1 and \\n2, you’ll train with three sets of 10 to 12 reps with \\n90 seconds of rest between sets. During weeks \\n3 and 4, the weight increases and the reps drop \\nto six to eight per set. Increase the rest to two \\nminutes between sets. For the final two weeks \\n(weeks 5 and 6), you increase the weight again \\nand drop the reps to four to six per set. Increase \\nthe rest periods again to three minutes between \\nsets to allow ample recovery time. The abdominal \\nand core exercises, however, increase in reps. For \\nthese, the weight should stay the same or even \\nincrease over the six weeks, and rest should be \\nconstant at one minute between sets.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 9.27 Three-Stepping for Strength'),\n",

On the Thursday upper-\\nbody workout, you should switch the order of the \\nexercise pair on all exercises except the bench \\npress. The Tuesday lower-body workout focuses \\non the squat, and the Friday lower-body workout \\nfocuses on the deadlift. You will do five sets of \\neach exercise pair. The first exercise should be \\ndone for no more than five reps with a weight that \\nis about 50 to 70 percent RM (a weight that allows \\nyou to complete about 12 to 20 reps) for that \\nexercise. The key is doing these reps explosively \\nand not fatiguing the muscles. Rest no more than \\n60 seconds between exercises and do four to six \\nreps on the second exercise. Normally that would \\nbe a weight that is about 85 to 90 percent RM. \\nHowever, the additional strength you get from the \\nantagonist exercise may allow you to complete \\nfour to six reps with up to 95 percent RM. After \\ncompleting the fifth set of the second exercise, \\ndo one set to failure of the first exercise with a \\nweight that normally allows you to complete about \\n8 to 10 reps. Follow this program for no more \\nthan six weeks before cycling back to standard \\nstraight-set training.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nThis training method involves training oppos -\\ning muscle groups and exercise movements to \\nincrease muscle strength. With this method, you \\ntrain exercises that are opposing movements and \\ntrain opposing muscle groups back to back. That \\nis, you do one set of the first exercise and follow \\nit with one set of an exercise that is the opposite \\nmovement of that first exercise. This is similar to \\nsuperset training with a longer rest period allowed \\nbetween the opposing exercises. For example, \\nduring front-to-back training you will train the bench \\npress and barbell row together.\\nThe advantage of training opposing muscle \\ngroups back to back is that you’ll be stronger in \\nthe second exercise. Research has found that a \\nmuscle will be stronger if preceded immediately \\nby a contraction of its antagonist, or opposing \\nmuscle group. For example, when you do a super-\\nset of barbell row and bench press in that order, \\nyou’ll be stronger on the bench press—as long as \\nyou don’t train to failure on the row. The reason \\nfor this phenomenon is that, to some degree, the \\nagonist muscle is limited by its antagonist. When \\nbench-pressing using straight sets, for example, \\nthe back muscles inhibit the contraction of the \\npectoral muscles to a certain extent. Doing a set \\nof rows shortly before benching, however, lessens \\nthis inhibitory effect, allowing your pecs to contract \\nmore forcefully.\\nThe front-to-back training routine presented in \\ntable 9.29 uses an upper- and lower-body training \\nsplit for a total of four workouts per week.

Open-chain exercises are those \\nwhere the resistance is in your hands or at your \\nfeet, such as leg extensions and most dumbbell \\nupper-body exercises.

There are only \\ntwo programs covered here because few lifters \\ninterested in training for strength view training \\nfrequency as an important variable to cycle in \\nan effort to increase muscle strength. However, \\nchanging the frequency of your training can have \\na dramatic effect on gains in muscle strength. The \\noverreaching method and the up-and-down strength \\nmethod are two programs that are effective at \\nenhancing strength by manipulating the frequency \\nof training.\\nOverreaching Method\\nThis program actually causes you to overtrain in \\nan effort to increase strength. The program design \\nis based on research investigating overtraining \\nin athletes. But the concept is not all that new. \\nIt originated from training principles from the \\nEastern Bloc countries. Overreaching is basically \\novertraining without suffering from the negative \\neffects of overtraining. The trick is backing off at \\nthe right time. The difference between overtraining \\nand overreaching is mainly time. Overtraining is a \\nmore chronic situation. It’s not something that can \\njust happen in a couple of days; it may take two \\nto four weeks of training too heavily or too long \\nto become truly overtrained. By then hormonal \\nperturbations usually have surfaced and so will \\nthe classic signs: fatigue, loss of appetite, lack of \\nstrength, muscle loss, insomnia, and depression.\\nOverreaching is similar to overtraining in that \\nthe training is the same. The difference is that \\noverreaching is for a short period and ends before \\nthe catastrophic changes in your body’s physiology \\nhave taken place. In other words, overreaching \\nis overtraining before the overtrained state is \\nreached. For four weeks you will train all muscle \\ngroups five days per week. See table 9.31 for the \\noutline of the overreaching training split. You will \\ndo three sets per exercise; each week the weight \\nincreases and the reps decrease. The exception is \\nthe Friday workout, where you train using maximal \\neffort (up to 100 percent RM) on the squat, bench \\npress, and deadlift. At the end of the four weeks, \\nyou back off on the training frequency as well as \\nthe weight and slow it down to training each muscle \\ngroup just once per week with a squat–bench \\npress–deadlift training split. During this back-off \\nphase your strength will increase dramatically. In \\nfact, in the study that the overreaching method is \\nbased on, researchers discovered that after two \\nweeks on the back-off phase, the trained lifters \\nhad increases in 1RM strength of more than 10 \\npercent on both the bench press and squat.\\nRATING\\nTime 1 2 3 4 5\\nLength 1 2 3 4 5\\nDifficulty 1 2 3 4 5\\nResults 1 2 3 4 5\\nTABLE 9.31 Overreaching for Strength\\nWEEKS 1-4\\nMONDAY AND WEDNESDAY\\nExercise\\nWEEK 1 WEEK 2 WEEK 3 WEEK 4 Rest between \\nsets (minutes)Sets Reps Sets Reps Sets Reps Sets Reps\\nSquat 3 10-12 3 8-10 3 6-8 3 4-6 3\\nLunge 3 10-12 3 8-10 3 6-8 3 4-6 2\\nBench press 3 10-12 3 8-10 3 6-8 3 4-6 3\\nBarbell shoulder press 3 10-12 3 8-10 3 6-8 3 4-6 2\\nLat pulldown 3 10-12 3 8-10 3 6-8 3 4-6 2\\nDumbbell curl 3 10-12 3 8-10 3 6-8 3 4-6 2\\nLying triceps extension 3 10-12 3 8-10 3 6-8 3 4-6 2\\nStanding calf raise 3 15-20 3 12-15 3 10-12 3 8-10 1\\nHanging leg raise 3 15-20 3 15-20 3 15-20 3 15-20 1'),\n",

This chapter \\nis designed to help you take the information you \\nhave learned from chapter 8 (basic program design \\nfor training programs that build maximal strength) \\nand chapter 9 (advanced training techniques) and \\nput it together to build a long-term training program \\nthat works to continually build strength.\\nThis chapter starts by teaching you how to test \\nyour 1RM. Regardless of your training level, you \\nneed to assess your strength level accurately for \\nbest results from your training. The first training \\nprogram offered in this chapter is a beginner \\nprogram. If you have little experience in strength \\ntraining, this program will enable you to take on \\nthe basic strength programs that are most effec-\\ntive for gaining strength. Once you have followed \\na strength training program consistently for at \\nleast six months, you are ready to take on an \\neffective program based on the splits discussed \\nin chapter 8. If you are at the intermediate level, \\nthese programs use the percentage method of \\ntraining. This is a training system that gradually \\nincreases the weight used by a percentage of \\nthe 1RM.\\nAdvanced lifters, those with over a year of \\nstrength training experience, can begin using the \\nmethods and techniques covered in chapter 9. One \\ncycle found in the following section is an advanced \\nprogram that alters these techniques throughout \\nthe different phases. Finally, if you are interested \\nin increasing your strength in one lift, you can refer \\nto the sections that focus on just one lift.\\nTESTING ONE-REPETITION \\nMAXIMUM\\nRegardless of where they are starting from, all lift-\\ners interested in training to build maximal strength \\nhave one goal in common—more strength! With the \\nexception of powerlifters, who commonly test their \\n1RM strength in competition, most lifters do not \\nroutinely test their strength by maxing out. \\nMaxing \\nout, a slang term, means to test your strength \\nby seeing how much weight you can lift for one \\nultimate rep on an exercise (usually on the three \\nstrength moves: bench press, squat, and deadlift). \\nAnyone who is interested in developing muscle \\nstrength needs to routinely test 1RM strength on \\nthe bench press, squat, and deadlift.\\nAssessing your strength on the bench press, \\nsquat, and deadlift is important for several rea -\\nsons. Because the bench press represents upper-\\nbody strength, the squat represents lower-body \\nstrength, and the deadlift represents whole-body \\nstrength, knowing your maximal strength on each \\nof these lifts will give you an indication of your over-\\nall body strength as well as indicate any strength \\nimbalances you may have. Norms have been estab-\\nlished that indicate how strong a person should be \\non each of these lifts. For strength norms relative \\nto body weight, refer to table 10.1. Testing your \\n1RM on the bench press, squat, and deadlift and \\ncomparing your relative strength on each to the \\nestablished norms will indicate how your strength \\nlevels compare to the strength levels of others. \\nYou can do this by dividing your 1RM in pounds'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength228\\non each lift by your body weight in pounds. For \\nexample, if your bench press 1RM is 300 pounds \\nand you weigh 150 pounds (68 kilograms), your \\nrelative strength on the bench press is 2. The \\nBalanced Strength box provides a ratio of squat \\nto deadlift to bench press strength. Comparing \\nyour own 1RM strength ratios of these three lifts \\ncan indicate whether you have balanced strength \\nor whether you are particularly weak or strong \\non a particular lift. Knowing whether you have an \\nimbalance can help you tailor your training to work \\ntoward improving the weaker lifts.\\nAnother important reason to assess your 1RM \\nstrength on the bench press, squat, and deadlift \\nis to determine the training weights that will cor -\\nrespond to each phase of your strength training \\nprogram. When training for strength, you will train \\nusing a percentage of your 1RM on the major \\nlifts—such as 85 percent of the 1RM or 85 percent \\nRM. The only way to know how much weight you \\nshould train with is to know how much your 1RM \\nis. For example, if your current 1RM on the squat \\nis 400 pounds and you are in a training phase that \\nrequires 85 percent RM, then you should train with \\n340 pounds on the squat. This requires frequent \\nretesting because your strength will increase while \\nyou are training with effective strength programs. \\nYou should plan on testing your 1RM about once \\nevery four to six weeks to keep your training \\nweights accurate with your current level of strength.\\nLast and most obvious, it’s important to test \\nyour 1RM strength to assess the effectiveness \\nof each program you use in your strength training \\nTABLE 10.1 Relative Strength\\nValues listed as “good” represent 1RM that is greater \\nthan the general population. Values listed as “excellent” \\nrepresent observed 1RM values for advanced lifters. \\nValues listed as “elite” represent observed 1RM values \\nfor competitive-level powerlifters.\\nRating Male Female\\nBENCH PRESS\\nGood >1.25 × body weight >0.8 × body weight\\nExcellent ≥1.75 × body weight 1 × body weight\\nElite ≥2 × body weight ≥1.25 × body weight\\nSQUAT\\nGood >2 × body weight >1.5 × body weight\\nExcellent ≥2.5 × body weight ≥2 × body weight\\nElite ≥3 × body weight ≥2.5 × body weight\\nDEADLIFT\\nGood ≥2 × body weight ≥1.5 × body weight\\nExcellent ≥2.5 × body weight ≥2 × body weight\\nElite ≥3 × body weight ≥2.5 × body weight\\nBalanced Strength\\nHere I list the suggested ratio of bench press to squat to deadlift 1RM weight. This can be used to \\ndetermine whether your upper-body, lower-body, and overall strength are balanced. Having a ratio on \\na lift that is much higher or lower than the suggested ratios would indicate areas in which you should \\nwork on bringing your strength up to par with the others.\\nA balanced ratio of bench to squat to deadlift is 1:1.5:1.5.*\\nFor example, if your bench press is 300 pounds, your squat is 450 pounds, and your deadlift is \\n425 pounds (300:450:425), your ratio would be 1:1.5:1.4.\\nThis would suggest your strength in these three lifts is balanced.\\nIf your bench press is 300 pounds, your squat is 700 pounds, and your deadlift is 650 pounds \\n(300:700:650), your ratio would be 1:2.33:2.17.\\nThis would suggest your strength on the bench press is well below your squat and deadlift strength. \\nThis means your training should focus on bringing up your bench press and upper-body strength.\\n*In practice the weight for the deadlift tends to be slightly less than the weight for the squat.\\nregimen. Knowing your 1RM for the bench press, \\nsquat, and deadlift (or any other exercise you want \\nto increase your strength on) before you start a \\nprogram and after you finish it is the only way to \\ndetermine how effective a strength training pro -\\ngram is and whether you should consider using \\nthe same program in the future.\\nTo test your maximal strength on an exercise, \\nyou must have a capable spotter to assist you,'),\n",

The first step to testing your 1RM \\nis to do several light warm-up sets starting with \\nthe bar itself and gradually move up in weight \\nover those several sets until you are close to your \\ntrue 1RM weight. Rest three minutes after your \\nfinal warm-up before testing your 1RM. Estimate \\na conservative 1RM weight and try it for one rep. \\nRest three to four minutes before making another \\nattempt. If you failed on the second attempt, sub-\\ntract 5 to 10 pounds and try again. If you were \\nsuccessful on the attempt, add 5 to 10 pounds \\nand try another attempt. Keep doing this, resting \\nthree to four minutes between sets until you fail \\nan attempt. The weight you lifted on the prior set \\nis your true 1RM.\\nAlthough not considered nearly as accurate, it \\nis possible to estimate your 1RM without doing a \\ntrue 1RM test. There are several equations that \\nyou can use to estimate 1RM based on how many \\nreps you can complete with a certain amount of \\nweight. This is a good option if you have an injury \\nthat could be worsened by training with extremely \\nheavy weight or if you want to avoid doing a true \\n1RM for whatever reason. The most commonly \\nused equation is the Epley formula, also known \\nas the Nebraska formula:\\n1RM = [1 + (0.0333 × reps completed)] \\n× weight lifted\\nUsing this equation, if you completed 10 reps \\non the bench press with 225 pounds, then\\n1RM = [1 + (0.0333 × 10)] × 225 pounds\\n1RM = 1.333 × 225 pounds\\n1RM = 300 pounds\\nAfter estimating your 1RM with the Nebraska \\nformula, use that weight to determine your relative \\nstrength, your training weight, or how much progress \\nyou have made with a particular strength program.\\nBEGINNER OVERALL \\nSTRENGTH PROGRAM\\nIf you have more than six months of consistent \\nlifting experience, you can take on the majority of \\nbasic strength training programs that are designed \\nto build maximal strength. The reason is that most \\nprograms for developing maximal strength start \\nwith lighter weight and higher reps and gradually \\nincrease the weight and decrease the reps per -\\nformed. This systematic progression can prepare \\nyou to hoist heavy weights. However, if you have \\nless than six months of experience, you are a \\nspecial case because of the immaturity of your \\nnervous system in regard to the specific exercises \\nthat you perform in your training regimen. Any time \\nthe body learns a new movement pattern—such \\nas the barbell squat—it requires time for nerve \\nconnections to be strengthened and muscle fiber \\ncontractions to be synchronized. These adapta -\\ntions of the nervous system can have a dramatic \\neffect on strength gains in a short period of time. \\nIt is these adaptations that make up the majority of \\nthe strength gains that beginners make. Therefore, \\nyou should design a beginner strength training \\nprogram to enhance these adaptations.\\nTo enhance the neural adaptations that you \\nneed as a beginning lifter, this program empha -\\nsizes repetition—that is in the number of reps per-\\nformed per set and the frequency of training. The \\ntraining split used is a whole-body strength training \\nsplit done on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, or \\nany three days per week allowing one full day of \\nrest between workouts (see table 10.2). In each \\nworkout a different strength exercise is empha -\\nsized and performed as the first exercise of the \\nworkout. Training the same exercises three times \\nper week helps the nervous system to “learn” the \\nmovement patterns of the exercise, strengthening \\nthe nerve connections that are required. During the \\nfirst three months of the program, the assistance \\nexercises stay the same for every workout (except \\nfor abdominal and core exercises). In the last three \\nmonths, the assistance exercises are switched \\nup in each workout to provide better variety in an \\neffort to stimulate different muscle fibers, which \\nmay help to enhance strength on the three lifts.\\nThe repetitions start out very high (20 per set \\nfor the first four weeks) and progressively drop \\nevery four weeks as the weight increases. This first \\nfour-week phase starts with weights equal to 55 \\npercent RM on most lifts. This is a great starting \\nweight if you are unaccustomed to doing particular \\nexercises. The high reps further enhance the nerve \\nconnections and synchronicity of muscle fiber con-\\ntractions that you need to develop to perform the \\nexercises with correct form and maximal force. Sets \\nstart out at three per exercise for all exercises for \\nthe first three months. During the fourth and fifth \\nmonths, you will perform all exercises for four sets.'),\n",

It follows the classical peri-\\nodization format but increases the weight in very \\nsmall increments each week—usually just 2 to 3 \\npercent of the 1RM. See table 10.3 for the details \\nof the small-step cycle. Depending on the weight \\nof your 1RM, these increments may be as small \\nas 2.5 pounds (the smallest increment available \\nwith weight plates) or as high as 25 pounds (for \\nelite powerlifters with lifts up to 800 pounds). \\nThis constant and small increase in weight used \\neach week is often referred to as \\nmicroloading. It \\nis believed that constantly challenging the muscle \\nwith progressively heavier weights forces the mus-\\ncles to adapt by increasing their capacity to produce \\nforce (that is, muscle strength). This follows the \\nprinciple of progressive overload. In addition to the \\nprescribed percent RM used each week, this cycle \\nhas scheduled retesting of the 1RM. This allows \\nfor fine-tuning of the percent RM as the 1RM will \\nincrease over the course of the training cycle.\\nTABLE 10.3 Small Steps to Strength\\nHYPERTROPHY PHASE\\nWeek Sets Reps\\nWeight \\n(% RM)\\nRest \\n(minutes)\\n 1* 5 15 55% 1-2 \\n 2 4 15 57% 1-2 \\n 3 3 12 60% 1-2 \\n 4 3 12 62% 1-2 \\n 5* 3 10 65% 1-2 \\nSTRENGTH PHASE\\n 6 5 10 67% 2 \\n 7 5 8 70% 2 \\n 8 4 8 73% 2 \\n 9* 4 7 75% 2 \\n10 3 6 77% 2 \\nPOWER PHASE\\n11 3 6 80% 3 \\n12 3 4 82% 3 \\n13* 3 4 85% 3 \\n14 3 3 87% 3 \\nPEAKING CYCLE\\n15 3 3 90% 4 \\n16 2 2 92% 4 \\n17* 2 1 95% 5 \\n18 2 1 97% 5 \\n19 Off or active rest\\n20* Competition or testing of 1RM\\n*1RM test week.\\nCountdown Cycle\\nAlthough all the basic strength training programs \\nhave some form of gradual progression where the \\nreps performed at each workout decrease over \\ntime, the countdown cycle uses a corresponding \\nsystem that matches sets, reps, and weeks that \\neach phase is followed in a 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 count-\\ndown progression. See table 10.4 for the weekly \\nprogression of the countdown cycle. To expand on \\nthis, the first phase lasts six weeks and uses six \\nsets of six reps for each exercise. The next phase \\nlasts five weeks and uses five sets of five reps. \\nThis pattern continues with each phase dropping \\none week, one set, and one rep until the final week, \\nwhere one set of one maximal rep is performed \\nfor each exercise.

This is great for those who like to keep rep \\nranges fairly constant. However, training weights \\ndo change each week over the 15-week program \\nwhile the reps are kept constant throughout each \\nof the two phases. As the weight increases, the \\nnumber of sets decreases and rest between sets \\nincreases. See table 10.5 for the specifics of the \\n9 to 5 cycle. Weight increments are small, similar \\nto the small-step cycle, but this one stops at 85 \\npercent and doesn’t go higher. Many believe that \\ngoing much higher isn’t necessary for building \\nmaximal strength.\\nTABLE 10.5 Getting Strong 9 to 5\\nPHASE 1: 9 REPS\\nWeek Sets Reps\\nWeight\\n(% RM)\\nRest \\n(minutes)\\n1* 8 9 50% 2\\n2 8 9 53% 2\\n3 8 9 55% 2\\n4 7 9 57% 2\\n5* 7 9 60% 2\\n6 7 9 62% 2\\n7 6 9 65% 3\\n8 6 9 67% 3\\n9* 6 9 70% 3\\n10 5 9 73% 3\\nPHASE 2: 5 REPS\\n11 5 5 75% 4\\n12* 4 5 77% 4\\n13 4 5 80% 4\\n14 3 5 82% 4\\n15 3 5 85% 4\\n16* 1RM test\\n*1RM test week.\\nOne-Year-Plus Intermediate Program\\nIf you are an intermediate lifter you should con -\\nsider following the previous cycles in the order \\npresented—starting with the small-step cycle, \\nfollowing with the countdown cycle, and finishing \\nwith the 9 to 5 cycle. This will carry you through \\nover 55 weeks—just over a solid year—of well-\\nplanned strength training. With the conclusion \\nof this year plan you will be ready to progress \\ninto more advanced training cycles. One great \\nadvanced training cycle to follow the 9 to 5 cycle \\nthat concludes the year of intermediate training \\ncycles is the 85-plus strength cycle found in the \\nadvanced training cycles section that follows. See \\ntable 10.6 for a sample training cycle progression \\nthat puts you in the rank of advanced weightlifter.\\nTABLE 10.6 Strength Calendar\\nWeeks Cycle Notes\\n1-20 Small-step cycle\\n21 Active rest Stay out of gym but take \\nup other activities\\n22-43 Countdown cycle\\n44 Active rest Stay out of gym but take \\nup other activities\\n45-60 9 to 5 cycle\\n61 Active rest Stay out of gym but take \\nup other activities\\n62- 85-plus strength\\nADVANCED STRENGTH \\nTRAINING CYCLES\\nThe cycles that follow are advanced in the sense \\nthat they require greater skill and training exper -\\nience in order to be used safely and properly. These \\nprograms are considered advanced for several \\nreasons—they may start off at a heavier weight or \\nthey may require the use of advanced techniques. \\nThis does not imply that the training cycles cov -\\nered in the basic strength training cycles are not \\nuseful for advanced weightlifters. Those programs \\nmay be basic in their progression; however, many \\nelite competitive powerlifters use them. These \\nadvanced programs are designed for the advanced \\ntrainer who has a more difficult time continuing to \\nmake large strength gains, since basic programs \\nmay not always do the trick.'),\n",

After all, the longer you \\ntrain, the stronger you get; the stronger you get, \\nthe harder it is to get stronger. This is because \\ntrained lifters with greater strength are close to \\nreaching the height of their genetic strength ceiling. \\nThis advanced program is designed to encourage \\nstrength gains in even the most seasoned lifter. In \\neach of the six phases, the cycle uses an advanced \\ntraining technique to encourage strength gains. \\nThe constant cycling of weight and reps, along \\nwith the specialized training techniques, prevents \\nstagnation and promotes continual strength gains \\nthroughout the eight-month cycle.\\nThis cycle uses a squat–bench press–deadlift \\ntraining split that is meshed with a push–pull \\ntraining split. That is, the workouts are divided into \\nthree separate workouts—squat, bench press, and \\ndeadlift with upper-body pushing exercises (shoul-\\nders and triceps exercises) done with the bench \\npress day and the upper-body pulling exercises \\n(back and biceps exercises) done with the deadlift \\nday. For variety, each phase alters the order of \\nthe training split. See table 10.8, Advanced Six, \\nfor details.\\nDuring the first phase (weeks 1 to 5), the train-\\ning technique used is density training. This will \\nincrease the amount of weight you can perform 10 \\nreps with on the squat, bench press, and deadlift. \\nThis will carry over into greater strength on the 1RM \\nfor each of these lifts as well. This will be apparent \\nwhen you test your 1RM in week 6. That is the only \\ngym workout you will do in week 6.\\nIn phase 2 (weeks 7 to 9), the training days are \\nreorganized so that the deadlift day is first and the \\nsquat day is last. The bench press workout still is \\nleft in the middle to separate the two workouts that \\nboth use lower-body muscles to allow for better \\nrecovery. You will do working sets with 80 percent \\nRM—however, this will be heavier than you could \\npreviously lift because of the boost in strength from \\nthe density training. The technique for this phase is \\nforced-rep training. This is a mass-training technique \\ncovered in chapter 6. The reason it is included here \\nin a strength cycle is to encourage some growth \\nin muscle fibers—which can lend itself to greater \\nforce production and therefore muscle strength. In \\naddition, the procedure of forcing extra reps can \\nlead to direct increases in muscle strength. This \\nphase lasts just three weeks because of the high \\nintensity of the forced-rep training.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength238\\nPhase 3 (weeks 11 to 17) starts off using \\nabout 80 to 85 percent RM or a weight you can \\ndo for four sets of six reps. This will kick off the 5 \\npercent method that will carry this phase through \\nthe next seven weeks. Use the 5 percent method \\nfor each major lift and one assistance exercise \\nthat mimics the lift. In phase 4 (weeks 19 to 22) \\nyou will use a static contraction technique that \\ncalls on potentiation to enhance muscle strength \\non the second set. You will do working sets with \\n90 percent RM. Phase 5 (weeks 24 to 27) uses \\nanother potentiation technique known to boost \\nyour power on the three lifts. For each strength \\nexercise (squat, deadlift, and bench press), you \\nwill perform one rep with 95 percent of your 1RM \\nweight as quickly as possible. Rest for three \\nminutes and downshift to 50 percent of your \\n1RM weight and perform five reps as explosively \\nas possible. Repeat this three times to develop \\nexplosive strength. The final phase is yet another \\npotentiation program. This is basically the reverse \\nof the technique of the previous phase because it \\nuses explosive movements to enhance maximal \\nstrength. At the climax of this program your 1RM \\non all three moves will be dramatically enhanced. \\nFollow this final phase with one or two weeks of \\nactive rest before starting the cycle over or moving \\non to a new strength training cycle.\\nTABLE 10.8 Advanced Six\\nPHASE 1: WEEKS 1-5\\nWORKOUT 1: SQUAT\\nExercise Sets Reps %1RM Notes\\nSquat 10 2 (week 1) 80% Follow the density training method found in \\nchapter 9 for a goal of 10 reps.6 3 (week 2)\\n5 4 (week 3)\\n4 5 (week 4)\\n3 6 (week 5)\\nLeg press 3 10\\nLeg extension 3 10\\nLeg curl 3 10\\nStanding calf raise 4 20\\nWORKOUT 2: BENCH PRESS AND PUSH\\nBench press 10 2 (week 1) 80% Follow the density training method found in \\nchapter 9 for a goal of 10 reps.6 3 (week 2)\\n5 4 (week 3)\\n4 5 (week 4)\\n3 6 (week 5)\\nIncline dumbbell press 2 10 Perform the last set of each exercise to \\nmuscle failure.Flat dumbbell press 2 10\\nBarbell shoulder press 3 10\\nLying triceps extensions 3 10\\nHanging leg raise 4 12-15\\nWORKOUT 3: DEADLIFT AND PULL\\nDeadlift 10 2 (week 1)  80% Follow the density training method found in \\nchapter 9 for a goal of 10 reps.6 3 (week 2)\\n5 4 (week 3)\\n4 5 (week 4)\\n3 6 (week 5)'),\n",

However, after you have \\na strong base of overall strength from lifting for a \\ngood while, you may want to build up strength in \\ncertain lifts. This may be due to an imbalance of \\nstrength in a certain area. Or you may just have \\nan affinity for a particular lift and want to excel at \\nit. This is often common with the bench press. \\nThe following programs are designed to build up \\nyour strength in one lift and only one lift. However, \\nthis does not mean that you shouldn’t work on \\nincreasing your strength in the other lifts. These \\nprograms emphasize the bench press, squat, \\nor deadlift. However, they are designed to fit in \\nwith regular training splits. One way to use these \\ncycles is to alternate the three of them so that you \\nemphasize bench press strength at one phase in \\nyour training cycle, squat strength in another, and \\ndeadlift strength in another before cycling back to \\nbench press-focused training.\\nBench Press Booster Cycle\\nThis 10-week cycle involves using an upper- and \\nlower-body split so that you can train chest twice \\neach week (once on Monday with a heavy day and \\nonce on Thursday with a light day of bench press \\nwork). See table 10.9, Big Bench Routine, for \\ndetails. On the heavy chest day, all you do is bench \\npress. Weight increases and therefore repetitions \\ndecrease every three weeks until you reach the \\nlast week where you max out with your new record \\nweight. Allow three to five minutes of rest between \\nsets on your heavy bench day to keep your strength \\nup. On the light chest day you do the bench press \\nalong with the other upper-body assistance exer -\\ncises. In this workout, you’ll perform light bench \\npresses as well as dumbbell bench presses (incline \\nor flat) and flys (incline or flat). Rotate the incline \\nand flat version of these exercises so that when \\nyou do incline dumbbell presses, you follow with \\nflat flys and vice versa. Allow two to three minutes \\nof rest between sets on the light chest day.\\nPHASE 6: WEEKS 29-32\\nWORKOUT 1: DEADLIFT\\nExercise Sets Reps % 1RM Notes\\nDumbbell deadlift jump 3 3 30% \\nAlternated with deadlift 3 2-3 95%\\nBarbell row 3 2-3 95%\\nBarbell curl 3 2-3 95%\\nStanding cable crunch 3 6-8\\nWORKOUT 2: BENCH PRESS\\nPower push-up 3 3 Body weight\\nAlternated with bench \\npress\\n3 2-3 95%\\nBarbell incline press 3 2 95%\\nBarbell shoulder press 3 2 95%\\nClose-grip bench press 3 2 95%\\nHanging leg raise 3 15-20\\nWORKOUT 3: SQUAT\\nBarbell squat jump 3 3 30%\\nAlternated with squat 3 2-3 95%\\nLeg press 3 2 95%\\nStanding calf raise 3 2 95%\\nPHASE 6: WEEK 33\\nWORKOUT 1: PERFORM MID- TO LATE WEEK\\nTest your 1RM on the squat, bench press, and deadlift in that order.'),\n",

On Monday do a full squat workout \\nwith just two extra assistance exercises for quads \\n(the leg press and leg extension) as well as one \\ncalf exercise. On Wednesday you will perform just \\nthe prescribed number of squats and no other leg \\nwork before your bench press workout. On Friday \\nyou will do the same thing before your deadlift \\nworkout. Some lifters opt to train their squats in \\nthe morning on Wednesdays and Fridays and their \\nbench presses and deadlifts in the evening. This \\ncan help prevent the fatigue that may hinder your \\nother lifts after performing several sets of squats.\\nThe program starts at 80 percent RM and cycles \\nover the 18-day program to reach 100 percent by \\nthe 16th workout. Then it drops back to 80 percent \\nfor the 17th workout to give the legs a rest before \\nthe 18th workout, where you will test your 1RM with \\nat least 105 percent of your original 1RM before \\nthis program.'),\n",

In fact, this program is similar to one \\nused by many elite deadlifters, including Mark Phil-\\nlipi. This program works well with a squat–bench \\npress–deadlift training split, as long as you do the \\ndeadlift workout first in the week and the squat \\nworkout last (see table 10.11). It consistently uses \\njust one set of heavy weight for very low reps (one \\nor two) as the first working set of each workout. \\nOver the 10 weeks the weight for this set moves \\nfrom 75 percent to 100 percent. Following the \\nheavy set are several sets of light deadlifts done \\nexplosively. This builds up the power you will need \\nto explode the weight off the floor at the start of \\nthe deadlift. The first four weeks use a circuit \\nprogram for the assistance exercises. This helps \\nto condition the muscles to prevent fatigue. The \\nlast six weeks use straight sets for all assistance \\nexercises.\\nTABLE 10.11 Raising the Dead\\nBefore each workout, do several warm-up sets to get up to working-set weight.

After all, if \\nthe muscle that you have spent so much effort \\nbuilding is not readily visible, then what’s the point \\nof all that hard work? Sure, weight training has \\nmany health benefits and will improve your quality \\nof life, but those are all nice fringe benefits of the \\nmain reason you weight train—to look better. And \\nlooking better makes you feel better.\\nThe best way to enhance fat loss is with a \\nproper combination of weight training and cardio \\nalong with diet. Techniques to employ in weight \\ntraining and cardio workouts are covered later in \\nthis chapter. Nutrition advice for promoting fat loss \\nis covered in chapter 28.\\nSTRENGTH TRAINING \\nTECHNIQUES THAT ENHANCE \\nFAT LOSS\\nThe very act of weightlifting can affect fat loss by \\nincreasing both the number of calories your body \\nburns during the workout and how many calories \\nyour body burns after the workout is long over. And \\nit can now be argued that the body of someone \\nwho weight trains is better equipped at burning \\nmore fat throughout the day and storing less fat. \\nYet years of research have proven that manipulat-\\ning certain acute training variables can have an \\neven bigger impact on the calories burned during \\nworkouts and the calories burned the rest of the \\nday after the workout is over.\\nExercise Selection\\nWhile a variety of exercises is always best, there \\nare certain types of exercises that you will want \\nto include in workouts to aid in fat loss. Research \\nsuggests that using multijoint, free-weight exer -\\ncises, such as the squat, bench press, shoulder \\npress, and bent-over row, will maximize the number \\nof calories burned more than machine exercises \\nor single-joint isolation exercises. This is likely \\nbecause multijoint exercises use more muscle \\ngroups, such as those that assist the target \\nmuscle and stabilizer muscles, which stabilize the \\njoints involved. And the more muscles you use, the \\nmore calories you burn. In fact, one study found \\nthat when participants did the barbell squat, they \\nburned 50 percent more calories than when they \\ndid the leg press (Tower et al. 2005).\\nResistance and Rep Range\\nThe weight you train with and the number of reps \\nyou complete can have a big impact on your calorie \\nburn. To burn more calories during the workout, \\nhigher reps do the trick. College of New Jersey \\nresearchers found that when participants used a \\nweight that allowed them to complete 10 reps on \\nthe bench press, they burned about 10 percent \\nmore calories than when they used a weight that \\nlimited them to 5 reps (Ratamess et al. 2007). The \\nmore reps you do, the more calories you burn. On \\nthe flip side of that, several studies have shown \\nthat while using heavier weight for fewer reps \\nburns fewer calories during the workout, it burns \\nmore calories when the workout is over and you \\ngo about the rest of your day. In fact, research has \\nshown that when you work out with heavy weights'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength254\\nthat limit you to 6 reps per set, the boost in your \\nmetabolic rate for 2 days after the workout more \\nthan doubles the boost you get when you work out \\nwith light weight that allows you to complete 12 \\nreps per set (Borshein and Bahr 2003). So some \\ncombination of both heavy weight for low reps and \\nlight weight for high reps is the best way to take \\nadvantage of both benefits. This can be achieved \\nby either using both low and high rep ranges in \\neach workout or periodizing the rep ranges of the \\nprogram.\\nVolume\\nThe total number of sets you do for each muscle \\ngroup and per workout (volume) will affect the \\nnumber of calories you burn in the workout. The \\nmore sets you perform, the more work you are \\ndoing, and the more calories you end up burning. \\nSo increasing total volume of workouts is not only \\na strategy that can help to increase muscle growth, \\nas discussed in chapter 2, but it can also increase \\nthe number of calories burned. As a general rule, \\nkeeping workouts to a minimum of 20 sets and \\nideally closer to 30 or more sets per workout can \\nlead to significantly greater fat loss than workouts \\nthat are under 20 sets.\\nRep Speed\\nA fourth variable to consider is the speed of the \\nreps that you perform. Research has shown that \\ndoing reps in a fast and explosive manner can \\nincrease the number of calories you burn both \\nduring and after the workout. Researchers from \\nBall State University had weight-trained males do \\na squat exercise using 60 percent of their one-rep \\nmax at a normal pace (2 seconds on the positive \\npart of the rep and 2 seconds on the negative \\npart of the rep) or a very fast pace (1 second on \\nthe positive part of the rep and 2 seconds on the \\nnegative part of the rep). For both workouts, they \\ndid 4 sets of 8 reps, during which they were hooked \\nup to a metabolic instrument to measure the \\nnumber of calories they burned. The researchers \\ndiscovered that when the participants did the 4 \\nsets of squats with fast reps, they burned over 11 \\npercent more calories during the workout and over \\n5 percent more calories at rest after the workout \\ncompared to when they used slower reps (Mazzetti \\net al. 2007).\\nWhile you don’t want to do every exercise with \\nfast and explosive reps, a better plan is to start \\nyour workouts with one exercise for each muscle \\ngroup done in an explosive manner. For example, \\nfor chest you can start the workout with three or \\nfour sets of power push-ups or Smith machine \\nbench press throws. This will help you build muscle \\npower in the chest, which can help you gain muscle \\nstrength as you burn fat. And since ballistic exer-\\ncises like this are done with light weight, they serve \\nas a good warm-up to the heavier working sets that \\nwill follow, such as the bench press.\\nRest\\nOne of the more critical variables for increasing fat \\nloss is the rest period you allow between sets. Gen-\\nerally speaking, the less rest you allow, the greater \\nthe number of calories you burn in a workout.\\nResearch from the College of New Jersey has \\nshown that if you cut your rest periods from the \\nstandard 3 minutes between sets to just 30 sec-\\nonds between sets, you can increase the number \\nof calories you burn during the workout by over 50 \\npercent (Ratamess et al. 2007). These shorter rest \\nperiods, compared to longer rest periods, also lead \\nto a bigger increase in the metabolic rate boost \\nthat follows the workout. Research also shows \\na similar response to supersets, which basically \\neliminates any rest periods between sets. This is \\ncovered in more detail in the following section.\\nWhile you should keep rest periods between \\nsets to a minimum, the one time to hold the rest \\nperiod between sets to at least one minute, if \\nnot longer, is when using the cardio technique of \\ncardioacceleration, where instead of truly resting \\nbetween sets you do cardio between sets. To learn \\nmore about cardioacceleration, see chapter 12.\\nIntensity Techniques\\nAnother thing to consider regarding weight training \\nfor maximizing fat loss is the use of intensity tech-\\nniques that allow you to take sets past the point \\nof normal muscle failure. For example, with forced \\nreps the assistance from a partner helps you go \\npast muscle failure by continuing to do more reps \\nthan you would be able to complete on your own. \\nResearch shows that this technique leads to a \\nhigher increase in growth hormone levels than by \\nsimply ending the set at muscle failure (Ahtiainen'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\n255Tactics for Maximizing Fat Loss\\net al. 2003). Since growth hormone (GH) increases \\nlipolysis, the release of fat from the fat cells, having \\nhigher GH levels can lead to more fat being freed \\nup from the fat cells so that it can be burned away \\nas fuel during the workout and after.\\nOne study on collegiate football players found \\nthat those following a high-intensity weight pro -\\ngram, which consisted of just one set per exer -\\ncise done for 6 to 10 reps per exercise done to \\nfailure along with forced reps and finally a static \\ncontraction for several seconds, lost more body fat \\nover 10 weeks than those using a lower-intensity \\nprogram, which consisted of three sets of 6 to \\n10 reps per exercise taken to just muscle failure \\n(Fincher 2004).\\nUsing the intensity technique, supersets also \\ncan enhance calorie burning and therefore fat loss. \\nOne study from Syracuse University reported that \\nparticipants supersetting chest and back, biceps \\nand triceps, and quads and hamstrings increased \\nthe number of calories burned during the workout \\nand the hour after the workout by 35 percent more \\nthan those performing the same chest and back \\nexercises as straight sets (Kelleher et al. 2010). \\nWhile this may be because an athlete uses more \\nmuscle fibers by supersetting different muscle \\ngroups, the fact that rest periods between sup -\\nersets are minimal is likely to be a big factor as \\nwell. The influence that rest periods have between \\nsets is discussed earlier in this chapter. This would \\nlikely mean that using techniques such as tri-sets \\nand giant sets, in which you train three and four or \\nmore exercises, respectively, back to back, would \\nprovide a similar effect, if not an even bigger one.\\nTraining Frequency\\nHow often you train muscle groups can also have \\nan impact on fat loss. The most obvious reason \\nfor this is that when you train muscle groups more \\nfrequently you tend to train more often during the \\nweek. More workouts during the week equate to \\nmore total calories burned throughout the weeks.\\nAnother reason more frequent workouts lead \\nto greater fat loss is that when you train muscle \\ngroups more frequently, you need to train more \\nmuscle groups per workout. This means that you \\nhave more muscle tissue that is recovering after \\nthe workout is over. After workouts your body is in a \\nstate known as oxygen debt. That means it needs \\nmore oxygen to replenish ATP and phosphocreatine \\nstores. It needs that oxygen to burn more fuel \\n(calories) to recover from the workout. With more \\nmuscle fibers needed to recover, the calorie burn \\nstays higher for longer.\\nSUMMARY\\nThe way in which you design your weight training \\nprogram can significantly affect fat loss. Generally \\nspeaking, programs that use many multijoint move-\\nments, incorporate explosive and ballistic training \\nexercises, use heavy weight for fewer reps, use \\nlighter weight for higher reps, keep rest periods \\nvery short, combine techniques such as supersets, \\nemploy intensity techniques such as forced reps, \\ntrain muscle groups more frequently, or have you in \\nthe gym more often all seem to be effective ways \\nto keep fat burning maximized.\\nOf course, you can’t employ all of these tech -\\nniques into every workout, but a good strategy is \\nto employ a multitude of these techniques in each \\nprogram you design and swap out techniques as \\nyou change up programs. You will also need to add \\nsome form of cardio to these strength programs in \\norder to maximize fat loss. Cardio techniques that \\nwork best are covered in chapter 12.\\nIf you are not keen at designing your own \\ntraining programs, turn to chapter 13, which has \\nseveral fat-loss programs. Not only have these \\nprograms been shown to be effective for fat loss, \\nbut trainees often have gains in muscle size and \\nstrength. These programs also serve as a good \\ntemplate for combining the techniques discussed \\nin this chapter.'),\n",

Aerobic exercise refers to the energy system \\nused. With weight training, which is done with high \\nintensity for short bursts followed by a short rest \\nperiod, you tend to rely more on the anaerobic \\nenergy systems to fuel muscle contractions. With \\naerobic exercise, which typically refers to rhyth -\\nmic movement at a low to moderate intensity for \\nprolonged periods, such as jogging or bicycling, \\nthe energy systems that fuel this type of activity \\nrequire oxygen.\\nAlthough it is possible to lose fat with just weight \\ntraining, especially certain types of programs, to \\ntruly maximize fat loss you need to incorporate \\nsome form of cardio in your training regimen. Plus, \\ncardio provides health benefits, such as improved \\ncardiovascular health, reduced risk of diabetes \\nand other metabolic diseases, and reduced risk of \\ncertain types of cancer. It can also help to enhance \\nrecovery from weight training. This chapter covers \\nthe most effective forms of cardio for fat loss while \\nmaintaining muscle and building muscle.\\nHIIT VERSUS STEADY-STATE \\nCARDIO\\nThere was a time when bodybuilders would only \\nconsider doing low- to moderate-intensity, steady-\\nstate cardio, such as fast walking or pedaling a \\nstationary bike at a moderate intensity. Anything \\nmore intense would be considered a no-no. There \\nwere two main reasons for this. The first was that \\nthey believed that more intense cardio would burn \\nup muscle tissue (meaning that muscle tissue \\nwould be broken down to fuel the exercise). The \\nsecond belief was that lower-intensity cardio was \\nreported to put a person in an optimal fat-burning \\nzone.\\nToday, we know that both of those lines of \\nthinking are flawed. The concept that high-intensity \\ncardio will burn up muscle while low-intensity cardio \\nwill spare muscle is quite wrong. In fact, if you just \\ncompared the muscle mass of longer-distance \\nrunners (who spend a good deal of their training \\nat a slower pace for longer periods) to the muscle \\nmass of sprinters (who spend a good deal of their \\ntraining at higher intensities for short periods), you \\ncould see how that logic is flawed.\\nWhen you train at a slow and steady pace for a \\nlonger period, you train your muscle fibers to be \\nmore aerobic and have greater endurance. There \\nis some evidence that suggests that muscle fibers \\nadapt to becoming more aerobic and to increas -\\ning endurance by becoming smaller and weaker. \\nThis is because the smaller a muscle fiber is, the \\nless time it takes for nutrients to travel within the \\nmuscle fiber. This speeds up the rate that nutrients \\ncan be burned for fuel.\\nAnother way to consider the misconception \\nthat low-intensity cardio done for longer periods \\nwill better spare muscle mass than high-intensity \\ncardio for shorter periods is to compare a high -\\ner-intensity squat workout done for 5 sets with a \\nweight that limits you to 10 reps per set and a low-\\ner-intensity squat workout done with a weight that \\nallows you to complete 100 reps per set. Would the \\nhigher-intensity leg workout of 10 rep sets burn up \\nmuscle tissue while the lower-intensity leg workout \\nof 100 rep sets would better maintain muscle? \\nNo. If anything, it would be quite the opposite. In \\nfact, doing higher-intensity cardio, particularly HIIT \\n(discussed later in this chapter), may actually help \\nto increase muscle mass.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength258\\nWhile lower-intensity cardio has been shown \\nto burn a higher percentage of calories from fat, \\nyou actually burn fewer total calories with lower-in-\\ntensity cardio. So to burn an equivalent amount \\nof calories and fat as higher-intensity cardio, you \\nwould have to exercise for considerably longer. \\nOne obvious problem with doing excessive cardio \\nis time. Most people barely have time to fit in a \\n60-minute weight workout, let alone another 60 \\nminutes or longer of cardio. However, another \\nproblem with excessively long cardio, particularly \\nfor men, is that it has been found to lower testos-\\nterone levels.\\nFocusing on just how many calories you burn \\nand how many calories you burn from fat during a \\nworkout is also flawed. The real benefit of cardio \\nfor fat loss is the amount of calories (and calories \\nfrom fat) that you burn the rest of the day after the \\nworkout is over. This is due to the process known \\nas EPOC (excess postexercise oxygen consump -\\ntion). It refers to the boost in your metabolism, or \\ncalorie burning that comes after the workout is \\nover. When you work out, you burn calories to fuel \\nyour muscles. But when the workout is over, your \\nbody keeps burning more calories than normal, \\ndespite the fact that you are doing nothing. This \\nis due to the processes involved in recovery from \\nexercise. After exercise, your body must repair \\ndamaged muscle fibers, restock muscle glycogen \\nlevels, remove lactic acid from the muscles, and \\nso on. All these processes require calories, and \\na lot of those calories come from fat. And when it \\ncomes to EPOC, this is where HIIT really destroys \\nsteady-state cardio done at a lower intensity.\\nScience Behind HIIT\\nHigh-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a form \\nof cardio that involves intervals of high-intensity \\nexercise (such as running at a very fast pace) \\ninterspersed with intervals of low-intensity activity \\n(walking at a slow pace) or complete rest. This is \\nin sharp contrast to the typical continuous steady-\\nstate (slow and steady) exercise that is done at a \\nmoderate intensity, such as walking at a fast pace \\nor jogging for 30 to 60 minutes.\\nAlthough HIIT seems to have gained popularity in \\nthe last few years, the concept is actually quite old. \\nThe origin of HIIT can be traced back many decades \\nto a technique called Fartlek training that was used \\nby track coaches to better prepare runners. Fartlek \\nis actually Swedish for speed (fart) and play (lek), \\nso it means speed play, which is essentially what \\nHIIT is. Today HIIT has crossed over to the fitness \\nindustry because of its beneficial results that have \\nbeen established through both anecdotal reports \\nand published research studies. In fact, studies \\ncomparing HIIT to continuous steady-state cardio \\nhave shown that HIIT is far superior for fat loss, \\ndespite the fact that it requires much less time.\\nOne of the first studies to discover that HIIT \\nwas more effective for fat loss was a 1994 study \\nby researchers at Laval University in Ste-Foy, \\nQuebec, Canada (Tremblay et al. 1994). They \\nreported that young men and women who followed \\na 15-week HIIT program lost significantly more \\nbody fat than those following a 20-week continu-\\nous steady-state endurance program, despite the \\nfact that the steady-state program burned about \\n15,000 calories more during exercise than the \\nHIIT program. A 2001 study from East Tennessee \\nState University demonstrated similar findings \\nwith participants who followed an 8-week HIIT \\nprogram (participants dropped 2 percent body \\nfat) compared to those who followed a continuous \\nsteady-state program (participants had no drop \\nin body fat) on a treadmill (King 2001). A study \\nfrom Australia reported that females following \\na 20-minute HIIT program that consisted of \\n8-second sprints followed by 12 seconds of rest \\nlost 6 times more body fat than the group who \\nfollowed a 40-minute cardio program performed \\nat a constant intensity of 60 percent of their \\nmaximum heart rate (Trapp 2008).\\nA study from the University of Western Ontario \\nsuggests that you can burn off more body fat \\nwith even less than 15 minutes of HIIT than with \\nslow and steady cardio (Macpherson 2011). The \\nresearch team had male and female participants \\nfollow one of two cardio programs for six weeks. \\nOne group ran slow and steady for 30 to 60 min-\\nutes three times per week. The other group did \\nfour to six 30-second sprints with a 4-minute rest \\nperiod between sprints three times per week. \\nThat’s basically HIIT with an extended rest interval \\nbetween the high-intensity exercise intervals. The \\ngroup doing the sprint intervals lost more than \\ntwice as much body fat as the slow-and-steady \\ngroup despite the fact that they did only 2 to 3 \\nminutes of total cardio exercise per day and just \\n6 to 9 minutes per week! The sprint interval group \\nalso gained over one pound of muscle. So this type \\nof cardio not only burns off body fat and spares \\nmuscle, but it also may even help to build it.'),\n",

Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine \\nreported that participants who followed a HIIT \\nworkout on a stationary cycle burned significantly \\nmore calories during the 24 hours after the work-\\nout than those who cycled at a moderate steady-\\nstate intensity (Treuth, 1996). The East Tennessee \\nState University study mentioned earlier also \\nfound that participants following the HIIT program \\nburned more calories during the 24 hours after \\nexercise than the steady-state cardio group did. \\nA study presented at the 2007 annual meeting \\nof the American College of Sports Medicine by \\nFlorida State University researchers reported that \\nparticipants who performed HIIT burned about 10% \\nmore calories during the 24 hours after exercise \\nas those who performed continuous steady-state \\nexercise, despite the fact that the total calories \\nburned during the workouts were the same (Meuret \\net al. 2007).\\nIn addition to the increase in resting metabo -\\nlism, research confirms that HIIT is effective at \\nenhancing the metabolic machinery in muscle cells \\nthat promote fat burning and blunt fat production. \\nResearchers in the Laval University study that \\nfound a decrease in body fat with HIIT discovered \\nthat the HIIT participants’ muscle fibers had \\nsignificantly higher markers for fat oxidation (fat \\nburning) than those in the continuous steady-state \\nexercise group. A study of young females who per-\\nformed seven HIIT workouts over a two-week period \\nshowed a 30 percent increase in both fat oxidation \\nand levels of muscle enzymes that enhance fat oxi-\\ndation (Talanian et al. 2007). Research shows that \\nthis may be due to an increase in mitochondria, \\nthe machinery in muscle cells and other cells that \\nburns fat to produce energy. Scalzo and colleagues \\n(2014) found that both men and women complet-\\ning four to eight bouts of 30-seocnd sprints on a \\nstationary cycle had significant boosts in mitochon-\\ndrial biogenesis. In a study from the Norwegian \\nUniversity of Science and Technology, participants \\nwith metabolic syndrome who followed a 16-week \\nHIIT program had a 100 percent greater decrease \\nin content of the fat-producing enzyme fatty acid \\nsynthase compared to participants who followed \\ncontinuous moderate-intensity exercise. In other \\nwords, HIIT enhances the body’s ability to burn \\nfat and prevent the storage of fat (Tjonna 2007).\\nAnother way that HIIT appears to work has to do \\nwith getting the fat to where it will be burned away \\nfor good. Talanian and colleagues (2010) shed \\nsome light on another way that HIIT burns more \\nbody fat: 6 weeks of HIIT increased the amount of \\nspecial proteins in muscle cells that are respon -\\nsible for carrying fat into the mitochondria (where \\nfat is burned for fuel) by up to 50 percent. Having \\nmore of these proteins in muscle means that more \\nfat can be burned up for fuel during workouts and \\nwhen resting.\\nHIIT , done at a higher intensity for a shorter \\ntime, will not only help you maintain your muscle \\nbut can actually help you build muscle mass. In a \\nstudy by Smith and colleagues (2009), male par-\\nticipants following a six-week HIIT program (done \\nfor 15 minutes per day, 3 days a week, at a ratio \\nof 2:1 for exercise to rest) while supplementing \\nwith beta-alanine gained over 2 pounds of muscle \\ndespite the fact that they never lifted weights \\nduring the program. The 2011 study on sprinting \\nfrom the University of Western Ontario discussed \\nearlier reported that those performing 30-second \\nsprint intervals actually gained some muscle mass, \\nwhile the slow-and-steady cardio group did not. \\nA study from the UK reported that obese partici -\\npants following a low-carbohydrate diet lost muscle \\nmass, yet those performing HIIT along with the \\nlow-carbohydrate diet were able to maintain muscle \\nmass (Sartor 2010). This makes sense when you \\nconsider that weight training is technically a form \\nof HIIT— short periods of high-intensity exercise \\nare interspersed with periods of rest.\\nOne reason HIIT can lead to greater gains in \\nmuscle mass may be an increase in muscle protein \\nsynthesis. The Colorado State University study \\nshowing an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis \\nalso reported a significant increase in muscle \\nprotein synthesis after the sprints. The results \\nwere greater in male than in female participants. \\nAnother reason for greater gains in muscle mass \\nwith HIIT may be the anabolic hormone testos -\\nterone. New Zealand researchers (Paton et al. \\n2009) had competitive cyclists complete 4 weeks \\nof HIIT training involving 30-second sprints on \\na stationary cycle separated by 30 seconds of \\nrest. One group sprinted with high resistance on \\nthe pedals, making it harder to pedal, while the \\nother group used a lighter resistance, which was \\neasier to pedal. Both groups pedaled as fast as \\nthey could during the 30-second sprints. The men \\npedaling at the highest resistance increased their'),\n",

When you improve insulin sensitivity, not \\nonly does this help you keep lean and prevent dia-\\nbetes, but it can also aid muscle growth. Insulin is \\nan anabolic hormone that acts on the muscle cells \\nto increase muscle protein synthesis, decrease \\nmuscle protein breakdown, and drive more glu -\\ncose, amino acids, and creatine and carnitine \\ninto muscle cells. Researchers at Watt University \\nin Edinburgh had participants follow a two-week \\ntraining program with workouts consisting of just \\nfour to six 30-second sprints on stationary cycles \\n(Babraj et al. 2009). Sprints were separated by 4 \\nminutes of rest. They discovered that at the end of \\nthe two weeks the participants’ blood glucose and \\ninsulin levels were reduced by almost 15 and 40 \\npercent, respectively, after the consumption of 75 \\ngrams of glucose. Insulin sensitivity, which is the \\nmeasurement of how well insulin does its job at the \\nmuscle cells, improved by about 25 percent. In a \\nmore recent study by Racil and colleagues (2013), \\nyoung females following a 12-week HIIT program \\nhad positive changes in insulin sensitivity as well \\nas reduced waist size, lower total cholesterol, lower \\nLDL cholesterol, and higher HDL cholesterol.\\nThis does not mean that you should never do \\nsteady-state cardio. If you enjoy jogging, hiking, or \\ncycling, then by all means include that exercise in \\nyour program. However, you should still consider \\nadding a few days of HIIT into your routine. This \\nnot only will improve your physique but will also \\nimprove your performance when you do steady-\\nstate cardio.\\nCardio Frequency\\nMany weight training enthusiasts ask about the \\nminimum amount of cardio that needs to be done \\neach week to result in fat loss? This question \\nusually comes from those who think that cardio is \\nonly the slow-and-steady type done on a treadmill \\nor stationary bike. Most people who enjoy weight-\\nlifting tend to loathe cardio. Of course, once they \\nrealize that cardio can be done with weights in HIIT \\nstyle, they end up asking how much is too much. \\nAt any rate, there is some evidence both from \\nresearch and anecdotal reports that the minimum \\namount of cardio that you should do each week is \\nthree workouts.\\nOne study placed 90 male and female partici -\\npants on an eight-week program that consisted of \\n30 minutes of straight cardio (Willis et al. 2009). \\nThey divided the participants into groups based on \\nhow often they exercised each week. One group \\nserved as a control and did no exercise, a second \\ngroup did the cardio workout fewer than two times \\na week, a third group did the workouts two or three \\ntimes per week, and the fourth group did cardio \\nfour or more times per week. They discovered that \\nat the end of the eight weeks only the last group \\nperforming cardio four or more times per week lost \\na decent amount of body fat (almost 15 pounds \\nof it). Of course, the participants were not weight \\ntraining in addition to doing cardio, and they also \\nweren’t doing HIIT , so it’s hard to say from this \\nstudy precisely how many days of cardio you need \\nin addition to weight training.\\nAnecdotal reports suggest a minimum of three \\nHIIT cardio sessions per week in addition to weight \\ntraining. But obviously, the more you do each \\nweek, the greater the expected fat loss. In fact, \\nyou can do seven days of cardio per week if you \\nprefer. And that can be seven days of HIIT . Some \\nare worried that doing HIIT every day will lead to \\novertraining. However, as long as you switch up \\nthe exercises, you can do HIIT every day of the \\nweek. After all, it is typically done for only 15 to \\n30 minutes, and that is not total exercise time. \\nResearch on athletes suggests that those using \\nHIIT every day had no decrement in performance. \\nHatle et al. (2014) found that those performing \\neight sessions of HIIT per week for 3 weeks had \\nsimilar increases in V·O\\n2max as those doing three \\nsessions per week for 8 weeks. This supports an \\nearlier study in Alpine skiers (Breil et al. 2010) that \\nshowed a 6 percent increase in V·O\\n2max after 15 \\nsessions of HIIT performed for 11 days. Both stud-\\nies, however, reported that the increase in V·O2max \\nwas not apparent until several days after stopping \\nthe frequent HIIT . This suggests that performing \\nHIIT every day could overtax the body and lead to \\novertraining. So if improving aerobic performance \\nis one of your goals, you should provide at least \\none rest day, if not three or four, per week. However, \\ndoing two or three weeks of HIIT every day can lead \\nto quicker improvements in endurance as long as \\nyou back off on the frequency later on. For the best \\nfat loss, do three to six sessions of HIIT per week, \\nleaving a minimum of one day of rest.'),\n",

The most critical \\naspect of scheduling your cardio is when you will \\nbe most consistent doing it.\\nIf you find that you tend to skip your cardio \\nworkouts when you leave it to after your weight \\nworkout, then you should consider doing it before \\nor during your weight training workout or at a com-\\npletely different time or day. There are two options \\nwhen it comes to doing cardio during your weight \\ntraining workouts. The first option is to do cardio-\\nacceleration, which involves a 30- to 90-second \\nbout of high-intensity cardio in between every set. \\nOr you can do a bout of HIIT in between muscle \\ngroups. For example, if you train back, biceps, and \\ncalves in one workout, you could do 10 minutes \\nof HIIT in between back and biceps, in between \\nbiceps and calves, and after calves for a total of \\n30 minutes of HIIT . Several studies have reported \\nthat breaking up your cardio into several shorter \\nsessions allows you to burn more calories during \\nthe workout as well as more calories after the \\nworkout is over (Altena 2003; Almuzaini 1998; \\nKaminsky 1990). This has also been shown to \\nallow people to lose significantly more total fat \\nover a prolonged period.\\nFasted Cardio\\nAnother misconception about cardio is that the \\nbest time to do it is first thing in the morning \\non an empty stomach. Research does in fact \\nshow that you burn more total fat when you do \\ncardio fasted than you would if you ate first. \\nSome research shows that you can burn 20 \\npercent more fat when you do cardio in the \\nmorning on an empty stomach (Gonzalez et al. \\n2013). However, as mentioned earlier, how many \\ncalories—and specifically the number you burn \\nfrom fat—during the exercise should not be the \\nmajor focus. When you burn carbohydrate during \\nexercise, you burn more fat after the exercise is \\nover, and when you burn more fat during exer -\\ncise, you burn more carbohydrate after (Deighton \\n2012). In other words, it’s more about the total \\namount of calories and fat you burn throughout \\nthe day, not just during exercise. Research also \\nsuggests that whether you exercise first thing in \\nthe morning fasted or fed, you end up burning \\nthe same amount of calories throughout the day \\n(Hansen 2005).\\nSo, generally speaking, your best bet is to not \\nworry about doing cardio first thing in the morning \\nor fasted. If doing cardio first thing in the morning \\nis best for your schedule, then by all means do \\nyour cardio then. But it is advisable to have at \\nleast a protein shake—ideally a protein shake \\nand some carbohydrate, such as fruit—before \\nthe workout. If you are trying to limit carb intake, \\nthen you may want to avoid the carbohydrate until \\nafter the workout.\\nThere is one time when fasted cardio may be \\na strategy you want to employ. I have found that \\nwhen a male’s body fat is in the low single digits \\n(somewhere around 5 to 6 percent) or a female’s \\nbody fat is in the low teens (somewhere around 13 \\nto 14 percent), but they have one body area that \\nthey cannot trim, then the fasted cardio seems \\nto be beneficial for dropping the stubborn fat. For \\nexample, many males, especially older males, tend \\nto hold fat on the lower back and obliques. Many \\nfemales tend to hold fat on the hips and thighs. \\nOnce they have dropped the majority of the subcu-\\ntaneous fat on the rest of the body, fasted cardio \\ndoes seem to work well to rid that last bit of fat. \\nAlthough there are no direct data, it may be that \\nwhen a person is so low in body fat, encouraging \\nthe body to burn more fat during exercise is one \\nway to burn off the stubborn body fat that other -\\nwise won’t go.\\nFORMS OF HIIT\\nHIIT can take on many forms and be done with \\nvirtually any equipment or absolutely none. You \\ncan do it while running on a track or a treadmill, \\nriding a stationary bike or climbing a stair stepper, \\nor doing calisthenics and using your body weight \\nor explosive exercises and free weights. Chapters \\n25 (whole-body exercises) and 26 (calisthenic \\nexercises) are good resources for exercises to \\nuse for HIIT .\\nThere is almost no wrong way to use HIIT other \\nthan not doing it at all. And while there are numer-\\nous exercises that you can do with HIIT , there are \\nalso numerous ways to employ HIIT . Following are \\nsome of the more effective ways to use HIIT .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength262\\nStandard HIIT\\nStandard HIIT refers to scheduling a block of time \\nfor just HIIT . Some evidence suggests that when \\ndoing HIIT , a ratio of 2:1 of high-intensity exercise \\nto low-intensity exercise, or work to rest, provides \\nthe best benefits in performance, fat loss, and \\nhealth. For example, you could sprint as fast as \\npossible for 30 seconds and walk for 15 seconds. \\nOr you could jump rope for 1 minute and rest for 30 \\nseconds. Of course, studies like the University of \\nWestern Ontario study on sprinting for 30 seconds \\nand resting for 4 minutes suggest that results \\nare still substantial even with a HIIT work-to-rest \\nratio of 1:8. Despite that, I would still recommend \\nshooting for a 2:1 ratio. If that is too much for you \\nto handle at first, start off with a 1:2, or a 1:4, \\nor even a 1:8 ratio of work to rest and gradually \\nincrease the ratio over time.\\nThe intensity of the high-intensity exercise inter-\\nvals can be something that is tightly prescribed, \\nsuch as a certain percent of your maximum heart \\nrate, or loosely determined based on what feels \\nintense to you. Because I prefer to do a variety \\nof exercises, such as dumbbell cleans, kettlebell \\nswings, and bench step-ups, checking your heart \\nrate manually or even on a heart rate monitor is \\npretty impractical. So I prefer to use a simple RPE \\n(rating of perceived exertion) scale of 1 to 10, as \\nshown in table 12.1. During the high-intensity exer-\\ncise intervals you should be somewhere from 6 to \\n9. Stick with the lower end of that range when just \\nbeginning with the goal of increasing your RPE as \\nyou go. If you are not taking complete rest between \\nthe high-intensity exercise intervals, then your RPE \\nduring the low-intensity exercise intervals should \\nbe somewhere in the range of 1 to 3.\\nYou should also shoot to increase the block \\nof total time spent doing HIIT as you progress. \\nEven if you start with just 10 to 15 minutes, that \\nis fine. But your goal should be to slowly increase \\nyour total time.\\nBeginner to Advanced HIIT Program\\nThe HIIT program in table 12.2 will progress you \\nfrom the beginner level to the intermediate level \\nof HIIT proficiency. This can be done with any \\nequipment, such as a treadmill, jump rope, pair \\nof dumbbells, kettlebell, exercise bands, medicine \\nball, TRX, or just your body weight and calisthenics.\\nThe suggested time of each phase is not carved \\nin stone. If you feel you need to spend more than \\ntwo weeks at a particular phase before moving \\nup, then do so. Or if a phase seems too easy and \\nyou want to jump right up to the next phase, then \\ndo so. It starts with a work-to-rest ratio of 1:4 in \\nphase 1 for a total workout time of just under 15 \\nminutes. Then in phase 2, it bumps up the amount \\nof time in the work phase to bring the ratio up to \\n1:2 and the total workout time to 17 minutes. In \\nphase 3, the rest is cut in half to bring the ratio \\nup to 1:1, and the total workout time increases \\nto 18.5 minutes. And finally in phase 4, the rest \\nis cut in half again to get the ratio to 2:1 and the \\ntotal time at 20 minutes.\\nTabata Intervals\\nTabata intervals use a 2:1 ratio of work to rest. \\nBut specifically you alternate 20 seconds of high-in-\\ntensity exercise with 10 seconds of rest done for \\neight cycles in this fashion for a total of 4 minutes \\nper exercise. The point is to not fall into a specific \\nheart rate range but to just go as intensely as \\npossible. So shoot for an RPE of about 9 to 10.\\nTabatas are named after the Japanese scien -\\ntist who designed them, Dr. Izumi Tabata.

For example, if you \\ntrained chest, triceps, and abs in one workout, you \\ncould start with Tabata rope jumping for 4 minutes \\nto warm up. Then after finishing chest, do Tabata \\nkettlebell swings for 4 minutes and Tabata bench \\nstep-ups for another 4 minutes before training \\ntriceps. After triceps, you could do 4 minutes of \\nTabata dumbbell cleans and Tabata jumping jacks \\nbefore training abs. Then you do more two more \\nTabata-style exercises after abs for a total time of \\n28 minutes of Tabata HIIT .\\nA typical Tabata exercise would look like this, \\nusing kettlebell swings as an example:\\nTime Activity\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\n20 seconds Kettlebell swings\\n10 seconds Rest\\nPower HIIT\\nPower HIIT involves doing intervals of explosive \\nexercises with short intervals of rest. These exer-\\ncises could include power cleans, snatches, squat \\njumps, power push-ups, and kettlebell swings. \\nThese exercises are typically done to develop \\nexplosive power, strength, and speed for sport \\nperformance. Combining them with HIIT allows you \\nto build more muscle power while increasing fat \\nloss and cardiorespiratory conditioning.\\nWith Power HIIT , both the exercise intervals and \\nthe rest intervals last 20 seconds. So it works on \\na 1:1 ratio of exercise to rest. This time frame \\ntypically allows you to complete about 3 or 4 reps \\nduring each exercise interval. This rep range is \\nperfect for building power. Then you get an equal \\namount of time to recover to help you better main-\\ntain power on the next exercise interval. This 1:1 \\nwork-to-rest ratio can also help to build muscle \\nsize, strength, and power by boosting testosterone \\nlevels. The New Zealand study discussed earlier \\nfound that cyclists performing 30-second high-pow-\\nered sprints separated by 30 seconds of rest (1:1 \\nwork-to-rest ratio) increased their testosterone \\nlevels by up to 100 percent.\\nFor each exercise you do three exercise-to-rest \\nintervals and then move on to the next exercises. \\nThis way you have worked at building power on \\nthat exercise without completely exhausting the \\nspecific muscles used on that move.\\nThe power exercises in Power HIIT are very fast \\nand explosive. These fast reps primarily recruit the \\nfast-twitch muscle fibers, which grow the biggest, \\nstrongest, and fastest. So it’s easy to understand \\nhow using HIIT workouts can help you build muscle \\nand power. But the fast-twitch muscle fibers also \\nburn the most calories when you use them, as \\ndiscussed in chapter 11. Plus, most of the exer -\\ncises in Power HIIT use so many muscle groups \\nthat they also burn more calories that way, as also \\ndiscussed in chapter 11.\\nPower HIIT Workouts\\nStart each Power HIIT workout with a 5-minute HIIT \\nwarm-up of rope jumping or jumping jacks. This \\nwarm-up should be done in typical HIIT fashion \\nat a 2:1 ratio of jumping to rest. In this case, it’s \\n30 seconds of jumping followed by 15 seconds \\nof rest. You do 7 cycles of this for a total of 5 \\nminutes. If you do the Power HIIT workouts after \\nweight training, then you do not need to do the \\n5-minute HIIT warm-up.\\nAfter the jump rope HIIT warm-up (see table \\n12.3), go right into the Power HIIT workout (see \\ntable 12.4). You do three 20-second sets of each \\nexercise, taking 20 seconds of rest between sets \\nand exercises. In workout A, start with squat jumps \\n(chapter 21) for building leg power. Then you move \\ninto power push-ups (chapter 14) for building power \\nin the chest and triceps. Next power cleans (chap-\\nter 25) are done with dumbbells or a barbell. Then \\nit’s on to medicine ball overhead throws (chapter \\n25). If you don’t have a medicine ball, you can \\nsimply do band shoulder presses (chapter 15) or \\neven barbell or dumbbell push presses (chapter \\n25). Finish with the band standing crunch (chapter \\n24) to build strength and power in the midsection.'),\n",

In workout B, you start with the \\nkettlebell snatch (chapter 25). You can also do \\nthis with a dumbbell as well if kettlebells are not \\nan option for you. Then you move into the band \\nsprint (chapter 26) and then calf jumps (chapter \\n23) to build strength and power in the calves. \\nThen do kettlebell swings (chapter 25), which can \\nalso be done with a dumbbell, and finish with the \\nband woodchopper (chapter 24) (or you can use \\na cable or a dumbbell) to build rotational power in \\nthe upper body and strengthen the core. Since you \\nhave to do both sides of the body, instead of doing \\nthree sets of 20 seconds each, do two 20-second \\nsets on each side for a total of four sets.\\nIn both workouts A and B you do five exercises \\nfor three 20-second sets each (except in workout \\nB where you have an extra set for woodchoppers) \\nwith 20-second rest periods; this totals 10 min -\\nutes. With the jump rope HIIT work for 5 minutes \\nand the 10 minutes of Power HIIT , that’s a total of \\n15 minutes of intense cardio that not only burns fat \\nand enhances cardiorespiratory fitness and health \\nbut also builds overall muscle strength, power, \\nand mass. If your goal is to maximize muscle \\nmass, strength, and power, and cardio is more \\nof an afterthought, then keep it at this duration. \\nWork on increasing the weight on the exercises or \\nthe number of reps you can bang out in those 20 \\nseconds. If fat loss is your primary goal, as well as \\nthe cardiorespiratory benefits that this novel form \\nof cardio offers, then you’ll want to progressively \\nbump up your total time of Power HIIT . I’ve offered \\nthree stages to work up to; each stage increases \\ntotal Power HIIT time. Go at your own pace, and \\nwhen the 15-minute workout no longer is much of \\na challenge, start on phase 2, which brings your \\ntotal HIIT workout to almost 20 minutes. Then \\nwhen that becomes less of a challenge, it’s time \\nto get serious and jump into phase 3, which brings \\nyour total HIIT workout time to 25 minutes.\\nYou can do the Power HIIT either at the beginning \\nor the end of your workouts or on a separate day. \\nIt all depends on your major goals. If you’re using \\nPower HIIT to boost muscle power and athletic \\nperformance, do this workout at the start of your \\nweight training or on a separate day from your \\nusual weight training altogether.

So, for exam-\\nple, on chest day, you would do one set of the \\nbench press; then instead of sitting on the bench \\nfor 2 to 3 minutes resting, you perform 30 to 90 \\nseconds of high-intensity cardio. Then you go do \\nthe next set of bench presses and continue in this \\nmanner throughout the entire workout.\\nMultiply those 30 to 90 seconds of cardio by the \\nnumber of sets you complete in each workout, and \\nit adds up. If you train chest, triceps, and abs, and \\ndo 12 sets for chest, 9 sets for triceps, and 9 sets \\nfor abs (30 total sets), and complete 60 seconds of \\ncardio between each set, then you just completed \\n30 minutes of high-intensity cardio during your \\nchest, triceps, and ab workout. That means that \\nyou don’t have to spend extra time doing cardio \\nafter the weight workout is over or on a separate \\nday. You can rest assured you’ve done your weight \\ntraining and your cardio, all in one fell swoop.\\nAlthough it may not be readily apparent, cardio-\\nacceleration is a form of HIIT . You are doing 30- to \\n90-second intervals of cardio and then moving on to \\na set of weightlifting. Then you go back to the cardio \\ninterval, and then back to the weight training interval.\\nCardioacceleration is based on a study by Uni-\\nversity of California at Santa Cruz researchers. \\nTrained participants completing 30 to 60 seconds \\nof cardio in between sets of weight training for over \\ntwo months recovered better than those resting \\nnormally between sets (Davis et al. 2008). Not only \\ndoes this method of HIIT allow for better recovery \\nafter workouts, but it allows for greater recovery \\nbetween sets. It is surprising that this technique \\nworks so well in aiding recovery between sets. In \\nfact, in my programs it has helped thousands of \\nmen and women break PRs while getting leaner \\nat the same time. Many worry that doing cardio \\nin between sets will decrease strength in weight-\\nlifting, but as I have found, once the body adapts \\nto the cardioacceleration, it appears to enhance \\nstrength and recovery between sets.\\nAnother nice thing about cardioacceleration is \\nthat it does not mean that you have to use the \\ntreadmill or other typical form of cardio equip -\\nment. You can do the cardio interval right there \\nat the station where you are weight training. So, \\nfor example, if you are doing the bench press, you \\ncan do 30 to 90 seconds of bench step-ups on \\nthe bench-press bench. If you’re doing dumbbell \\nflys, then do dumbbell cleans for cardio right next \\nto your bench. Or the simplest exercise of all is to \\nrun in place. This way you do not lose your spot in \\na busy gym. For good exercises to use for cardio-\\nacceleration, see chapter 26. Many exercises in \\nchapter 25 also work well for cardioacceleration.\\nStart at on the low end of scale with 30 sec -\\nonds of cardio in between sets. Over time, you \\ncan increase that by 15 seconds until you are \\nup to doing 90 seconds of cardioacceleration in'),\n",

Each workout \\nstarts with an explosive movement using fast-twitch \\nmuscle fibers that burn the most calories. The work-\\nouts also incorporate a lot of multijoint exercises \\nto burn more calories before and after the workout. \\nThey also employ both heavy weight for low reps to \\nboost metabolic rate after the workout and lighter \\nweight for high reps to boost calorie burn during \\nthe workout. Rest periods are kept short to keep \\nthe calorie burn up during and after the workout, \\nand some supersets are used to further the calorie \\nburn during the workout and after.\\nThis workout program follows a four-day training \\nsplit (see table 13.1). However, to truly maximize \\nfat loss, do all four workouts back to back over four \\ndays and rest on the fifth day. Then start over on \\nthe sixth day and continue in this fashion. Be sure \\nto add some form of HIIT to this program, whether \\nit’s a block of standard HIIT done separately from \\nthe workouts, cardioacceleration, or some form of \\nHIIT in between muscle groups.\\nFeel the Burn Workout\\nWORKOUT 1: CHEST, TRICEPS, ABS\\nExercise Sets/reps  Rest\\nPower push-up 3/5-8 30 sec\\nBench press 3/6-8 1-2 min\\nIncline dumbbell press 3/6-8 –\\nSuperset with incline dumbbell \\nfly\\n3/20 1 min\\nCable crossover 3/25 30 sec\\nSmith machine close-grip \\nbench press throw\\n3/5-8 30 sec\\nClose-grip bench press 3/6-8 1-2 min\\nCable lying triceps extension 3/20 –\\nSuperset with triceps \\npressdown\\n3/20 30 sec\\nHip thrust 4/to \\nfailure\\n–\\nSuperset with crossover \\ncrunch\\n4/to \\nfailure\\n30 sec\\n WORKOUT 2: LEGS, CALVES\\nExercise Sets/reps  Rest\\nSquat jump 3-3/5 30 sec\\nSquat 4/6-8 1-2 min\\nLeg press 3/20 30 sec\\nLeg extension 3/25 –\\nSuperset with leg curl 3/25 30 sec\\nRomanian deadlift 3/25 30 sec\\nStanding calf raise 4/10 –\\nSuperset with seated calf raise 4/30 30 sec\\nWORKOUT 3: SHOULDERS, TRAPS, ABS\\nExercise Sets/reps  Rest\\nSquat jump 2-3/5 30 sec\\nMedicine ball overhead throw 2-3/5 30 sec\\nSmith machine overhead press 3/6-8 1-2 min\\nDumbbell overhead press 3/6-8 –\\nSuperset with dumbbell lateral \\nraise\\n3/20 1 min\\nDumbbell bent-over lateral raise 3/25 30 sec\\nBarbell shrug 4/6-8 1-2 min\\nCable crunch 3/10 –\\nSuperset with plank 3/to \\nfailure\\n30 sec\\nOblique cable crunch 3/20 –\\nWORKOUT 4: BACK, BICEPS, CALVES\\nExercise Sets/reps Rest\\nDumbbell power row 3/8 30 sec\\nBarbell bent-over row 4/6-8 1-2 min\\nPulldown 4/6-8 –\\nSuperset with straight-arm lat \\npulldown\\n4/20 1 min\\nSeated cable row 3/25 30 sec\\nSmith machine curl throw 3/8 30 sec\\nBarbell curl 3/6-8 1-2 min\\nIncline dumbbell curl 3/20 –\\nSuperset with prone incline \\ndumbbell curl\\n3/20 30 sec\\nSeated calf raise 4/10 –\\nSuperset with leg press calf \\nraise\\n4/20 30 sec\\nTABLE 13.1 Feel the Burn Workout'),\n",

It also uses two forms of periodization: \\nlinear and reverse linear. The program splits each \\nmuscle group into two workouts each week. The \\nfirst half of the week (Monday, Tuesday, and Wednes-\\nday) you train using mainly multijoint exercises. For \\nexample, for chest you will only do presses using \\nboth barbell and dumbbells. The second half of the \\nweek (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), when you \\ntrain each muscle group for the second time, use \\nmainly single-joint (isolation) exercises. For exam-\\nple, on chest you will do only fly exercises such as \\ndumbbell flys and cable crossovers.\\nThe multijoint-focused workouts in the first half \\nof the week follow the linear periodized scheme \\nand get heavier each week. However, the sin -\\ngle-joint-focused workouts in the second half of the \\nweek follow a reverse linear periodization scheme \\nand therefore get lighter each week.\\nThere are a few exceptions for obvious reasons. \\nFor starters, there aren't any really useful multijoint \\nexercises for biceps. So the first biceps workout \\neach week you use barbell exercises, such as \\nbarbell curls and barbell preacher curls, while the \\nsecond half of the week you use dumbbell and \\ncable biceps exercises. Another issue is that there \\naren't many single-joint exercises for back, except \\nthe straight-arm pulldown and similar movements. \\nSo the first time you train your back each week, \\nuse rowing exercises, such as the barbell bent-over \\nrow and seated cable row. Then the second time \\nyou train your back that week, use only pulldown \\nexercises as well as the single-joint straight-arm \\npulldown. The other exceptions are abdominals, \\ncalves, and forearms.\\nThe weight workouts also enhance fat burning \\nbecause of the exercise selection and rep ranges. \\nThe multijoint exercises increase the amount of \\ncalories you burn during the workout. The high -\\ner-rep workouts also increase the number of calo-\\nries burned during the workout. The heavy-weight \\nand low-rep workouts, on the other hand, help to \\nboost calorie and fat burn after the workout.\\nThere are two three-week phases to this six-\\nweek program (see table 13.2). In phase 1 you \\nstart with reps in the range of 9 to 11 for the \\nmultijoint-focused training in the first half of week \\n1. For the single-joint-focused work in the second \\nhalf of the week, you do reps in the range of 12 \\nto 15. In week 2 for the multijoint-focused training \\nin the first half of the week, the weight increases \\nto drop the rep range down to 6 to 8 per set. The \\nsecond half of the week when you are doing the \\nsingle-joint-focused work, the weight is reduced to \\nallow reps to increase to 16 to 20 per set. Then \\nin the third and final week of phase 1, weight \\nincreases again to drop reps down to just 2 to 5 \\nper set on the multijoint-focused workouts in the \\nfirst half of the week. And in the second half of \\nthe week during the single-joint-focused workouts, \\nweight decreases again and reps go up to 21 to \\n30 per set.\\nIn phase 2 the cycle repeats again. So in the \\nfirst week, which is week 4 of the program, the \\nweight is reduced to allow the reps to go back to \\n9 to 11 per set during the first half of the week \\nfor the multijoint-focused workouts. And the weight \\nincreases for the single-joint-focused work in the \\nsecond half of the week to bring the reps back \\ndown to 12 to 15 per set. And each week it follows \\njust as in phase 1. However, the major difference \\nin phase 2 is that the majority of exercises are \\ndifferent except for a few of the staple exercises \\nthat are key for strength. Changing up the exer -\\ncises allows you to target slightly different fibers \\nin the muscles for the best overall gains in size.\\nTo enhance fat loss, not to mention aid recovery, \\nthis program uses cardioacceleration in between \\neach set in every workout. If you keep moving from \\nexercise to exercise without taking any rest before \\nor after the cardioacceleration, you can complete \\nmost of these workouts in under an hour. That’s less \\nthan an hour for both weight training and cardio.\\nI’ve also included an intensity technique that I \\ncall cardioaccelerated rest-pause/drop sets. On \\nthe last set of each exercise you take that set \\nto muscle failure. Then you rack the weight and \\n“rest” 15 to 20 seconds. I say “rest” because you \\nwon’t really rest. You will do cardioacceleration by \\nrunning in place for those 15 to 20 seconds. Then \\nyou pick up the weight again and continue doing \\nreps for that exercises until you reach muscle \\nfailure again. But you’re not finished yet. Now you \\nimmediately decrease the weight you are using \\nby 20 to 30 percent and continue doing reps of \\nthat exercise until you reach muscle failure again. \\nNow you are finally finished with that exercise \\nand can move on to the next one. For body-weight \\nexercises, or exercises where the weight is so \\nlight that you cannot do a drop set, you will do \\nShortcut to Shred Program\"),\n",

So \\nafter reaching muscle failure on the last set of an \\nexercise, immediately go into 15 to 20 seconds \\nof running in place. Then continue doing reps of \\nthat exercise until you reach muscle failure again. \\nThen immediately do another 15 to 20 seconds of \\nrunning in place, and then immediately do more \\nreps of that exercise until you reach muscle failure \\nyet again.

For many \\nmuscle groups, this second exercise pair is done \\nas a preexhaust superset; a single-joint (isolation) \\nexercise is first with lighter weight and a multijoint \\nexercise is next with heavy weight second.\\nEvery two weeks the SS8 program progresses. \\nThe heavy exercises progress in a linear periodized \\nfashion, so they get heavier and you complete \\nfewer reps per set every two weeks. And every two \\nweeks the light exercises progress in a reverse \\nlinear periodized fashion to get lighter and you \\nperform more reps per set. This progression will \\nhelp you get bigger and stronger as well as leaner, \\nbecause it will further boost the calories burned \\nduring and after the workout.\\nAnother change that occurs every two weeks on \\nSS8 is rest between sets. Start off in weeks 1 and \\n2 allowing one minute of rest between supersets. \\nBut every two weeks the rest period drops by 15 \\nseconds. So in weeks 3 and 4 you are allowed 45 \\nseconds of rest, in weeks 5 and 6 you get only 30 \\nseconds of rest, and in weeks 7 and 8 you get 15 \\nseconds of rest, which is basically get no real rest \\nTABLE 13.2 Shortcut to Shred Program (continued)\\n*On the last set do cardioaccelerated rest-pause/drop sets.\\n**Use ankle weights or hold dumbbell between feet if needed.'),\n",

You go back and forth \\nbetween the two exercises with no rest other than \\nthe time it takes to move into that next exercise, \\nwhich is about 15 seconds. You do this until all \\nthree or four supersets are completed. Then you \\nimmediately move into the next superset.\\nThe other addition to this program for maximal \\nfat loss is the use of Tabata HIIT in between muscle \\ngroups. For example, on the chest, shoulders, and \\ntriceps workouts when you finish the last chest \\nsuperset, do Tabata HIIT before you move on to \\nsupersets for shoulders. And after finishing shoul-\\nders, do Tabata HIIT before moving on to triceps. \\nAt the end of the workout, finish with more Tabata \\nHIIT work. For info on Tabatas, see chapter 12.\\nSince the rest periods decrease every two \\nweeks, you cannot use cardioacceleration (see \\nchapter 12) properly with this program. So the \\nnext best thing, or maybe even the better thing, is \\nTabata HIIT in between muscle groups. In weeks \\n1 and 2 do just one Tabata exercise in between \\nmuscle groups for a total time of 12 minutes of \\nTabata per workout. But in week 3 that increases \\nto two exercises done Tabata style between \\nmuscle groups for a total of six exercises and a \\ntotal time of 24 minutes of Tabatas. If you are \\nwell conditioned and accustomed to HIIT , then \\nyou can consider starting in weeks 1 and 2 with \\ntwo Tabata exercises between each muscle group \\ntrained.\\nWEEKS 1, 2\\nWORKOUT 1 (MONDAY): CHEST, SHOULDERS, TRICEPS\\nExercise Sets/reps Rest\\nBench press 3/9-10 – \\nSuperset with dumbbell fly 3/12-15 1 min\\nIncline dumbbell fly 3/12-15 –\\nSuperset with incline dumbbell \\npress\\n3/9-10 1 min\\nPush-up* 8/20 sec 10 sec\\nDumbbell shoulder press 3/9-10 –\\nSuperset with dumbbell lateral \\nraise\\n3/12-15 1 min\\nBent-over dumbbell lateral raise 3/12-15 –\\nSuperset with dumbbell upright row 3/9-10 1 min\\nKettlebell/dumbbell swing* 8/20 sec 10 sec\\nClose-grip bench press 2/9-10 –\\nSuperset with lying triceps \\nextension\\n2/12-15 1 min\\nTriceps pressdown 2/12-15 –\\nSuperset with overhead cable \\ntriceps extension\\n2/9-10 1 min\\nDead landmine* 8/20 sec 10 sec\\nWORKOUT 2 (TUESDAY): LEGS, CALVES, ABS\\nExercise Sets/reps Rest\\nSquat jump 3/3-5 –\\nSuperset with leg extension 3/12-15 1 min\\nFront squat 3/12-15 –\\nSuperset with squat 3/9-10 1 min\\nLeg curl 3/12-15 –\\nWORKOUT 2 (TUESDAY): LEGS, CALVES, ABS (cont.)\\nExercise Sets/reps Rest\\nSuperset with dumbbell Romanian \\ndeadlift\\n3/9-10 1 min\\nSquat* 8/20 sec 10 sec\\nLeg press calf raise 3/12 –\\nSuperset with body-weight \\nstanding calf raise\\n3/to \\nfailure\\n1 min\\nLunge* 8/20 sec 10 sec\\nHanging leg raise 3/to \\nfailure\\n–\\nSuperset with oblique crunch 3/to \\nfailure\\n1 min\\nCrunch* 8/20 sec 10 sec\\nWORKOUT 3 (WEDNESDAY): BACK, TRAPS, \\nBICEPS, FOREARMS\\nExercise Sets/reps Rest\\nBarbell row 3/9-10 – \\nSuperset with reverse-grip barbell \\nrow\\n3/12-15 30 sec\\nStraight-arm pulldown 3/12-15 –\\nSuperset with wide-grip pulldown 3/9-10 30 sec\\nKettlebell snatch* 8/20 sec 10 sec\\nBarbell shrug 3/9-10 –\\nSuperset with behind-the-back \\nbarbell shrug\\n3/12-15 30 sec\\nDumbbell clean* 8/20 sec 10 sec\\nSeated barbell curl 2/9-10 –\\nSuperset with barbell curl 2/12-15 30 sec\\nTABLE 13.3 Super Shredded 8 Program\\n> continued\\n*Do these exercises Tabata style.'),\n",

German volume training is \\nalso known as 10 × 10 training. You do 10 sets of \\n10 reps. This technique is used in chapter 9 in the \\n5 × 10 program. As the name implies, hundreds \\ntraining involves doing 100-rep sets.\\nWith HIIT 100s you start each workout by doing \\n10 sets of 10 reps for one exercise per muscle \\ngroup. The HIIT comes from the rest periods \\nbetween those 10 sets. Start with just 60 sec -\\nonds of rest between sets and progressively drop \\nit down by 10 seconds over the 6 weeks, until you \\nhave no rest and you're doing 100 reps straight \\nthrough. And that brings us to hundreds training. \\nBy the way, 10 sets of 10 reps is also 100 reps. \\nAnd when you're resting only 10 or 20 seconds \\nbetween sets in the last few weeks of the program, \\nit feels just like you're doing 100 reps straight \\nthrough. Most people are not able to complete all \\n100 reps straight through on HIIT 100s exercises \\nin week 6. Don't worry. If you fail to reach 100 \\nreps, simply rest as many seconds as you have \\nreps left to complete until you hit 100 reps. For \\nexample, if you hit only 70 reps straight through, \\nthen rest 30 seconds and continue.\\nYou start each workout doing one exercise per \\nmuscle group using HIIT 100s. Then follow that by \\ndoing three more sets of the same exercise using \\nyour 10-rep max (a weight that you can normally get \\nfor 10 reps). Of course, after doing 10 sets of 10 \\nreps, you will no longer be able to complete 10 full \\nreps with your 10-rep max weight. You will likely be \\nable to complete only about 5 to 7 reps. On the third \\nset, do a drop set by dropping down to the weight \\nthat you used for HIIT 100s and do as many reps as \\npossible before you reach muscle failure. Then you \\ndo three sets of one or two more exercises for that \\nsame muscle group, depending on the muscle group. \\nRest between all sets after the HIIT 100s exercise \\nwill be only one minute to maximize fat burning.\\nFollow the muscle-group-specific weight training \\nwith a final HIIT 100s using a full-body weight \\nexercise, such as barbell or dumbbell cleans, \\nkettlebell swings, barbell or dumbbell deadlifts, \\nbarbell or dumbbell snatches, one-arm kettlebell \\nor dumbbell snatch, or my unique lift known as the \\ndead curl press.\\nOn the HIIT 100s sets during weeks 1 through \\n3 when rest periods are 30 seconds or more, per-\\nform the first 3 sets of 10 as fast and explosively \\nas possible. This will help to build more muscle \\npower and strength, despite using such light \\nweight. Then for sets 4 through 6, do them slowly \\nand in control, focusing on the contraction with \\neach rep and squeezing each rep at the top for 1 \\nto 2 seconds. This helps to build the mind–muscle \\nconnection, which is critical for muscle size, shape, \\nand separation. During weeks 4 through 6, when \\nrest periods are down at 20 seconds and less, \\nyour goal is to just complete the hundred reps. So \\ndon’t worry about rep speed or control. Just get \\nthe reps done with the best form possible while \\nyour muscles are on fire.\\n \\n*Do these exercises Tabata style.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength288\\nFor each exercise, you will do HIIT 100s with \\nselect a weight that is equal to about 50 percent \\nof what you normally could do on that exercise for \\n10 reps. Don’t worry if you went too heavy. If you \\nfail to complete all 10 sets of 10 reps during the \\nprogram, you can adjust your weight either during \\nthat set or at the next workout. If you can’t com -\\nplete all 10 reps before hitting the eighth set of 10 \\nreps, then immediately drop the weight by 5 or 10 \\npounds before the next set of 10 reps. If you can’t \\ncomplete 10 reps during or after the eighth set, \\nfinish all 10 sets doing as many reps as possible for \\nthose final sets. Then the next time you train that \\nmuscle group, lower the weight by 5 to 10 pounds.\\nIf some of the exercises that you will do HIIT \\n100s with are new to you, then you’ll need to \\nspend some time figuring out how much weight \\nyou can do for 10 reps. The week before you \\nstart the actual HIIT 100s program, work these \\nexercises into your training program to figure out \\nan approximate weight that allows you to perform \\n10 reps but no more. Then when you start the \\nprogram the next week, use half of that weight for \\nyour HIIT 100s sets.\\nWhen trying to estimate your 10-rep max on \\neach exercise, be sure to do the HIIT exercise \\nas the first exercise for that muscle group. For \\nexample, if you don’t know what your 10-rep max \\nis on the bench press, do bench press as the first \\nexercise in your chest workout, aiming for a weight \\nthat allows you to complete just 10 reps. Then \\nfollow with your typical chest routine.\\nWhile the major benefit of this program (see \\ntable 13.4) is rapid fat loss, the fringe benefits \\nare just as impressive. Even though weight is light, \\nmuscle growth will be a pleasant surprise, espe -\\ncially while you are simultaneously dropping body \\nfat. You will have insane growth in muscle groups \\nthat you do not typically train with high volume, \\nlike traps, forearms, and calves. But you may also \\nbe surprised about the muscle growth you get in \\nplaces like your arms and legs. One of the best \\nways to optimize muscle growth is by making a \\ngiven weight more difficult. And HIIT 100s makes \\na very light weight difficult to move. The stress your \\nmuscle receives because of the difficulty in moving \\nthat weight repeatedly is what influences muscle \\ngrowth. This pushes muscle fatigue to new levels, \\nwhich stimulates the production and buildup of \\nbiochemical waste products. These waste products \\nare not a complete waste, since they stimulate \\nthe release of hormones such as growth hormone \\n(GH), which not only boosts muscle size but also \\nencourages fat burning.\\nOf course, another obvious benefit to doing 100 \\nreps with progressively shorter rest periods is an \\nincrease in muscle endurance. This will boost your \\nconditioning for almost any sport. And even if you \\ndo not participate in any sport, this benefit will \\nring loud and clear in your workouts. When you \\ngo back to normal training, where you are resting \\na couple of minutes between sets, your muscle \\nrecovery will be quicker, which means you will be \\nable to get more reps with the same weight than \\nyou normally would on successive sets. That’s \\nbecause progressively dropping your rest periods \\neach week forces your muscles to gradually learn \\nhow to recover more quickly between sets.\\nMost people do not even need to add extra \\nHIIT cardio when following this program. The HIIT \\n100s sets are adequate enough to stimulate fat \\nburning. However, feel free to add some extra \\nHIIT if you wish. You can add cardioacceleration \\nto the non-HIIT 100s sets, or add HIIT in between \\nmuscle groups, or a HIIT workout after the HIIT \\n100s workout.'),\n",

This way you get the combined benefit \\nof fat loss while actually building some muscle. \\nDoing very high reps with light weight for short \\nperiods can help you blow past plateaus and add \\nsome serious lean muscle.\\nBecause Tabata enhances endurance, it boosts \\nyour body’s ability to burn more fat. And because \\nit enhances explosive energy, the kind you use in \\na typical set of bench presses, it can help you get \\nmore reps with a given weight, or use more weight \\nto get a given number of reps. And that crosses \\nover to more strength as well as more muscle \\ngrowth, since a greater overload on the muscle \\nresults in greater growth.\\nAnd the benefits won’t end there. Because you \\ndo fairly high reps and take very short rest periods \\nbetween sets, you’ll increase the amount of blood \\nvessels that feed your muscle fibers. This will help \\nto get more nutrients, oxygen, and anabolic hor -\\nmones to your muscles, which means they’ll have \\nmore energy during workouts and better recovery \\nand growth after the workout.\\nThis Tabata program will have you doing several \\nexercises per muscle group in Tabata fashion. Do \\n2 to 4 exercises per muscle group. Each exercise \\nconsists of 8 sets of 20 seconds, getting as many \\nreps as possible in those 20 seconds. Rest only \\n10 seconds between the 20-second sets. Once \\nyou’ve completed 8 sets, rest 1 to 2 minutes and \\nthen do the same on the next exercise.\\nFinish each workout with four full-body or \\ncalisthenic exercises done in Tabata fashion for \\neven more fat burning. When you do these four \\nexercises, take no scheduled rest between the \\nexercises. Once you have completed all eight \\ncycles of one exercise, move into the next one as \\nquickly as possible.\\nIt will take some trial and error to select the \\nproper weight for each exercise. I suggest you \\nstart very light because you can work up in weight \\neach week. If you find a weight that allows you to \\ncomplete 20 seconds of reps for the first five or \\nsix sets but you cannot do the full 20 seconds \\non the last two or three sets, stick with that \\nweight. This way you can set a goal to complete \\nthe 20 seconds of reps for all eight sets before'),\n",

The pectoralis major muscles are divided \\ninto the upper and lower sections (see diagram). \\nAlthough many of these exercises are pressing \\nmovements (such as the bench press) that are \\nmultijoint exercises, requiring the use of the del -\\ntoids and triceps as well as the pectorals, they are \\nconsidered primarily chest exercises because of \\nthe movement of the upper arms. The chest exer-\\ncises are divided into barbell pressing exercises; \\ndumbbell pressing exercises; machine, cable, or \\nband pressing exercises; fly-type exercises; and \\npush-up, dip, and pullover exercises. Wherever \\na certain type of exercise is used in a workout, \\nany one of the same type can be substituted (for \\nexample, if the incline bench press is called for, \\nany barbell press exercise can be substituted).\\nUpper pectoralis\\nLower pectoralis'),\n",

The \\nbar will be several inches above your chest \\nand will not touch your chest.

Once the bar is positioned \\nover your chest, lower the bar to your lower \\nchest or upper abs and then press the bar \\nback up toward your head. If you must do \\nthis exercise alone, unrack the bar with an \\noverhand grip and lower it to your chest. With \\nthe bar on your chest, carefully swap your grip \\nfrom overhand to underhand and perform the \\nexercise.

Elbows are bent and upper \\narms are out to your sides, so your upper arms \\nform a 30- to 60-degree angle with your torso. \\nYour body should be extended behind you with \\njust your toes touching the floor.\\nMOVE\\nRaise your body up by pushing your palms into the \\nbench to fully extend your arms without locking \\nout the elbows at the top.

This makes the decline push-up harder \\nthan the standard push-up. Your hands are placed \\nfirmly on the floor and spaced slightly wider than \\nshoulder-width apart.

The deltoid muscles are divided \\ninto the front (anterior) head, middle (lateral) head, \\nand rear (posterior) head. (See the diagram.) \\nAlthough many of these exercises are pressing \\nmovements (such as the barbell overhead press) \\nthat are multijoint exercises, requiring the use \\nof the trapezius and the triceps as well as the \\ndeltoids, they are considered primarily shoulder \\nexercises because of the movement of the upper \\narms overhead. The shoulder exercises are divided \\ninto pressing exercises, upright row exercises, \\nand raises. There are also rotator cuff exercises \\nat the end for keeping your shoulder stabilizers \\nstrong and preventing injury, which is an all-too-\\ncommon problem among weightlifters with weak \\nrotator cuff muscles. The pressing exercises are \\nfurther divided into barbell overhead pressing exer-\\ncises; dumbbell overhead pressing exercises; and \\nmachine, band, and body-weight overhead pressing \\nexercises. The upright row exercises are further \\ndivided into barbell upright row exercises, Smith \\nmachine upright row exercises, dumbbell upright \\nrow exercises, cable upright row exercises, and \\nband upright row exercises. The raises are further \\ndivided into front raise exercises, lateral raise \\nexercises, and rear deltoid exercises.

After all, building muscle mass \\nand muscle strength go hand in hand to some \\ndegree. So nutrient requirements and timing are \\nvery similar whether you are trying to maximize \\nmuscle hypertrophy or muscle strength. And more \\noften than not, you are trying to do both at the \\nsame time.\\nAs mentioned in the introduction to this part, \\nthere is not enough room in this book to provide \\nyou with all the nutrition basics you will need to \\nunderstand. However, the guidelines here will serve \\nyou well in meeting your goals.\\nThese guidelines are what I have found to be \\nmost effective over decades of working with people \\nto maximize muscle growth and strength naturally. \\nThey are backed by science done in the lab, but \\nmore important they are backed by real-world \\nevidence in the gym on literally millions of people \\nusing them over the years. I’ve divided the guide-\\nlines into 10 goals to focus on with your diet. After \\nthe goals are sample meal plans based on the \\ngoals; you will discover how to incorporate these \\nplans into your day based on when you work out.\\nGOAL 1: FOCUS ON PROTEIN\\nMuscle is made of protein. To build muscle, you \\nneed to boost muscle protein synthesis as well as \\ndecrease muscle breakdown. Research in the lab \\nand the gym confirms that the best way to do this \\nis with a diet that gets you a minimum of 1 gram \\nper pound of body weight (a little over 2 grams \\nof protein per kilogram of body weight) and even \\ncloser to about 1.5 grams of protein per pound of \\nbody weight (about 3 grams of protein per kilogram \\nof body weight) per day. This is especially true for \\nthose following more intense training programs.\\nSeveral studies support the notion that getting \\nup to 1.5 grams of protein per pound of body weight \\nis effective for producing better gains in muscle \\nmass. Victoria University (Australia) researchers \\nhad weight-trained men consume about 1.5 grams \\nof protein per pound of body weight per day or \\n0.75 gram of protein per pound during an 11-week \\nweight training program (Cribb et al. 2007). The \\nhigher protein intake was achieved by supplement-\\ning with whey protein. The men who ingested the \\nhigher protein gained significantly greater strength \\nand muscle fiber protein in the quadriceps than \\nthe control group did. In a 2006 study by Candow \\nand colleagues, male and female participants sup-\\nplemented with either whey protein or soy protein \\nto bump up their daily protein intake to about 1.5 \\ngrams per pound of body weight per day during 6 \\nweeks of weight training. The control group con -\\nsumed about 0.75 gram of protein per pound. The \\nparticipants getting the greater protein, regardless \\nof the source, had significantly greater gains in \\nmuscle strength and growth. And in a study by \\nBurke and colleagues (2001), participants’ protein \\nintake was increased to 1.5 grams per pound of \\nbody weight per day during 6 weeks of weight train-\\ning with whey protein, while control participants \\nconsumed 0.5 gram of protein per pound. At the \\nend of the six weeks the participants getting the \\nextra protein gained significantly more strength \\nand muscle mass. A 2011 study by Witard and \\ncolleagues has also shown that even in endurance \\nathletes, when they double their protein intake \\nto close to 1.5 grams per pound of body weight \\nper day when training intensity is increased, they \\nrecover better and maintain better performance.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\nJim Stoppani’s Encyclopedia of Muscle & Strength528\\nDespite these studies and the many others \\nthat confirm that higher protein intake produces \\nbetter gains in muscle strength and mass, many \\nmisinformed dieticians, doctors, and scientists \\nstill believe that protein requirements for those \\nwho weight train are not that much different than \\nfor sedentary people who do little to no exercise. \\nThis is because there is also research showing that \\nincreasing protein intake during a weight-training \\nprogram has little impact on muscle growth or \\nstrength gains.\\nA review study (Bosse and Dixon 2012) on pro-\\ntein intake and strength training finally gives us \\nan answer to why some studies show that higher \\nprotein intakes produce better gains in muscle \\nmass and strength and why others show that it \\ndoesn’t. Many studies do not show a benefit of \\nincreased protein intake because protein intake \\nwas not increased enough from their baseline \\ndiets or protein intake was not increased enough \\ncompared to the lower-protein group. However, \\nwhen you look at studies that increase protein \\nintake by almost double the participants’ base -\\nline intake or increase protein intake by at least \\n50 percent of that consumed by the lower-protein \\ngroup or control group, then high protein intake \\ndoes lead to significant gains in lean muscle mass \\nand muscle strength.\\nThe bottom line is that eating a higher-protein \\ndiet is effective for gaining more muscle and \\nincreasing muscle strength. Shoot for 1 to 1.5 \\ngrams of protein per pound of body weight for \\noptimal results.\\nGOAL 2: GET AMPLE FAT\\nMany people still are misguided when it comes \\nto dietary fat. There is still a tendency to believe \\nthat you must keep fat low to be fit and healthy. \\nYet nothing could be further from the truth. Fat is \\nan important macronutrient for anyone interested \\nin building muscle and gaining strength as well as \\noptimizing health.\\nOne reason you need to take in adequate fat is \\nthat your body needs certain types of fat, such as \\nomega-3 fat (from fatty fish like salmon). This type \\nof fat has recently been found to be a critical player \\nin muscle recovery and growth. It also keeps body \\nfat at bay, aids joint health, protects from heart \\ndisease, and boosts brain function, among other \\nbenefits. A study by Smith and colleagues (2011) \\nsuggests that those supplementing with fish oil \\nhave a higher anabolic response (higher rates \\nof muscle protein synthesis) when consuming \\nprotein, which can lead to greater muscle growth \\nin the long run.\\nThen there is monounsaturated fat. This is not \\nan essential fat, but it is a healthy fat because it \\nprovides numerous health benefits and is readily \\nburned for fuel rather than stored as body fat. \\nOn top of that, male athletes consuming more \\nmonounsaturated fat maintain higher testosterone \\nlevels (Hamalainen et al. 1983; Reed et al. 1987). \\nActually, male athletes consuming more mono -\\nunsaturated fat \\nand saturated fat maintain higher \\ntestosterone levels. So, yes, you actually should try \\nto consume some saturated fat rather than try to \\navoid it at all costs. Good sources are beef, dairy \\n(full fat or reduced fat, but not fat-free), and whole \\neggs. The only fat that you want to avoid is trans \\nfat. The Malmo Diet and Cancer Study reported \\nthat individuals receiving more than 30 percent of \\ntheir total daily energy from fat and more than 10 \\npercent from saturated fat did not have increased \\nmortality (Leosdottir et al. 2005).\\nA simple rule for fat intake is to consume \\nhalf your body weight in pounds (or about your \\nentire body weight in kilograms) in grams of fat. \\nSo, if you weigh 200 pounds (90 kg), you would \\nconsume about 100 grams of fat per day, 33 per-\\ncent of it as monounsaturated fat, 33 percent as \\npolyunsaturated fat (mainly omega-3 fat), and 33 \\npercent as saturated fat each day. Also consider \\nsupplementing with 4 to 10 grams of fish oil per \\nday. If you really want to fine-tune this recommen-\\ndation, look to see how much DHA (docosahexae-\\nnoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) your \\nfish oil provides per capsule and try to get close \\nto 1500 milligrams DHA and 1800 milligrams of \\nEPA per day for maximal benefits.\\nGOAL 3: MANIPULATE \\nCARBOHYDRATE\\nBecause you want to make sure you’re eating \\nample protein and ample fat for maximizing muscle \\ngrowth, the amounts of these two critical macro -\\nnutrients should stay about the same regardless \\nof where you are in your diet or your goals. That \\nmeans to gain more mass or to lose more fat you \\nshould change your carb intake. The body can'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\Gym_book.pdf'}, page_content='Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com\\n529Nutrition for Maximizing Muscle Mass and Strength\\nmake all the glucose (blood sugar) it needs from \\nprotein and fat. So there is no essential carbohy-\\ndrate you need from your diet. Unlike with essential \\nfat you need to consume, and with protein there \\nare essential amino acids you need to consume \\nbecause the body doesn’t make them.\\nFor maximizing muscle growth and strength \\ngains while minimizing fat gains, start off some -\\nwhere around 1.5 to 2.0 grams of carbohydrate per \\npound of body weight. Then you can either increase \\nthis amount if you find that you are not gaining \\nmass rapidly enough and are not gaining any body \\nfat. Similarly, you can also gradually lower this \\namount if you find that you are gaining too much \\nbody fat. Everyone’s body is different, and your \\nbody will respond to carbohydrate differently. So \\nyou need to experiment with carbohydrate intake.\\nGOAL 4: COUNT CALORIES\\nCalorie intake is important for building muscle \\nand strength because you need to be in a positive \\nenergy balance (consuming more calories than \\nyou are burning) to truly maximize muscle growth. \\nHowever, if you are hitting the proper amount of \\nprotein and fat and have your carb intake dialed \\nin for your body, then how far over your energy \\nneeds or under you are doesn’t really matter . . \\n. to a point. As stated in rule 3, it is possible to \\ngain muscle while losing body fat. That being said, \\nto maximize muscle mass, you should be eating \\nmore calories than you are burning each day. And \\nto maximize fat loss, you should be burning more \\ncalories than you are consuming. However, it is \\npossible to burn slightly more calories than you are \\nconsuming yet gain muscle because you are eating \\nample amounts of protein and fat. We know that 1 \\ngram of protein provides 4 calories, as does 1 gram \\nof carbs. We also know that 1 gram of fat provides \\nabout 9 calories (8 to 10 calories, depending on \\nthe type of fat). If you build a diet from the mac -\\nronutrients up and want to be sure to get in 1.5 \\ngrams of protein per pound of body weight and 0.5 \\ngram of fat per pound of body weight, then that \\nis about 11 calories per pound of body weight. If \\nyou shoot for about 1 to 2 grams of carbohydrate \\nper pound of body weight, then you know that you \\nshould be eating at least 15 calories per pound of \\nbody weight to build muscle. If you find you need a \\ngood 3 grams of carbohydrate per pound of body \\nweight, then you need about 23 calories per pound.\\nGOAL 5: EAT FREQUENTLY\\nIt makes sense that if you’re trying to eat ample \\namounts of protein, fat, carbohydrate, and total \\ncalories every day, then a smart strategy is to eat \\nfrequent meals throughout the day. Decades of \\nexperience show that bodybuilders who eat more \\nfrequent meals build more muscle. Just about \\nevery top-level professional bodybuilder consumes \\na meal every couple of hours. These are men who \\ncarry the most muscle mass in the world. And on \\nthe other end of the spectrum, newborn infants, \\nthe smallest humans in the world, eat every 2 to \\n3 hours during the first few months of life when it \\nis absolutely critical that they rapidly gain mass.\\nAll this anecdotal evidence is interesting; how-\\never, clinical research also supports this notion \\nthat more frequent meals better promote muscle \\ngrowth. In a study by Moore and colleagues (2012), \\nparticipants performed a leg workout and then ate \\na total of 80 grams of whey protein over the next \\n12 hours in three methods. They consumed eight \\n10-gram doses of whey protein every 1.5 hours, \\nor consumed four 20-gram doses of whey every 3 \\nhours, or consumed two 40-gram doses of whey \\nevery 6 hours. The researchers reported that pro-\\ntein net balance, which is essentially muscle pro-\\ntein synthesis minus muscle protein breakdown, \\nwas significantly greater when they consumed the \\nfour 20-gram doses of whey protein every 3 hours \\nas compared to the other two dosing strategies. \\nGreater protein net balance essentially means \\nmore muscle growth.\\nThere are a couple of take-home points from this \\nstudy. The first has to do with amounts of protein. \\nThat the 10-gram doses of whey every 1.5 hours \\ndid not lead to greater protein net balance than the \\n20-gram doses every 3 hours is more a message \\nabout protein quantity than frequency. So you need \\nto get an adequate dose of protein at each meal, \\nand the minimum appears to be 20 grams. They \\ndidn’t look at higher doses taken more frequently, \\nbut I would suggest shooting for 20 to 40 grams \\nof protein per meal depending on the source.\\nThe second take-home point of the study is that, \\nto maximize muscle growth, you should not go much \\nlonger than 3 hours between meals. Any longer than \\nthis appears to increase protein breakdown too \\nmuch so that any major boost in protein synthesis \\nyou get is just making up for the breakdown and \\nnot maximizing the potential for muscle growth. So'),\n",

But \\nusing a protein powder isn’t just convenient; it also \\nprovides direct benefits for muscle growth, if you \\nuse the right kind.\\nFor the best protein powder, you definitely want \\nto have some form of whey protein. Whey protein \\nis a milk protein. Milk contains two primary types \\nof protein: whey and casein. Whey is the soluble \\nportion of milk protein, making up 20 percent of \\nthe protein, while casein is the globular portion \\nand makes up the remaining 80 percent. So whey \\nstarts out as whole milk from cows. The whey is \\nseparated from the casein in the cheese manu -\\nfacturing process. It’s literally drained off and sent \\non its way to processing for whey protein. It then \\nundergoes a variety of filtering steps to remove a \\ngood deal of the carbohydrate (lactose) and fat and \\ntake the whey from being about 15 percent protein \\nto 35 percent protein, then to 50 percent protein, \\nand then to 80 percent protein concentrate. These \\nare all considered whey protein concentrates; the \\n80 percent protein is the one most commonly used \\nin protein powders using whey protein concentrate. \\nThe gentle filtration process that produces whey \\nprotein concentrate leaves the whey protein microf-\\nractions in place. These include beta-lactoglobulin \\n(~50-55%), alpha-lactalbumin (~20-25%), glyco -\\nmacropeptide (~10-15%), immunoglobulins (~10-\\n15%), serum albumin (~5-10%), lactoferrin (~1%), \\nlactoperoxidase (<1%), and other minor proteins \\nsuch as beta-microglobulin, lysozyme, insulin-like \\ngrowth factors (IGFs), and gamma-globulins, which \\nprovide the major benefits of whey, such as anti-\\noxidant and immune-boosting benefits, as well as \\nenhance muscle growth and strength.\\nTo further purify the whey protein and create a \\nwhey protein isolate that is greater than 90 percent \\nprotein, the 80 percent whey protein concentrate \\nundergoes a further process, often involving \\nmicrofiltration or ion exchange chromatography to \\nremove more of the carbohydrate and fat. Depend-\\ning on the processing involved, creating an isolate \\nsometimes damages the microfractions of whey. \\nSo there can be a cost of a purer whey protein \\npowder. This is the reason my whey protein isolate \\nundergoes microfiltration and ultrafiltration, which \\npreserves the important whey microfractions, is \\nsought after. Some whey protein also undergoes \\nthe process of hydrolysis. This essentially breaks \\nthe long whey protein chains into much shorter \\nchains, or peptides; some are just two or three \\namino acids in length. These hydrolyzed whey \\nproteins are even quicker to digest than whey \\nisolate. The whey protein concentrate, isolate, or \\nhydrolysate is then spray-dried to form a powder. \\nThe powder is often instantized so that it mixes \\nbetter in fluids and does not clump.\\nWhey is definitely the king of the protein pow -\\nders. This is due to several factors. The first is \\nthat it is rich in the branched-chain amino acids \\n(BCAAs), which are the most critical for muscle \\ngrowth, as well as energy. For more on BCAAs, \\nread goal 8 later in this chapter. No other protein \\nis as fast as whey protein, meaning that it gets \\nits amino acids into the bloodstream quite rapidly. \\nWhey delivers the majority of its amino acids to \\nthe bloodstream in about 60 to 90 minutes (figure \\n27.1; Boirie 1997). This allows it to rapidly turn \\non muscle protein synthesis for instigating muscle \\ngrowth. This is important around workouts to \\nenhance recovery and aid muscle growth while \\nthe muscle is primed for it. Whey protein also \\nprovides special peptides and microfractions that \\nother protein sources or straight-up amino acids \\ndon’t. These peptides and microfractions provide \\nnumerous benefits to health, performance, and \\nphysique. For example, some peptides relax the \\nblood vessels to cause vasodilation. Not only does \\nthis provide cardiovascular health benefits, but it \\nhelps to deliver whey’s amino acids to the muscles \\nin a more efficient manner. A study comparing whey \\nprotein to an amino acid mix that provided the \\nsame amino acids that whey provides showed that \\nwhey protein increased muscle protein synthesis \\nbetter than the amino acids (Kanda et al. 2013).\\nYet as good as whey is at rapidly spiking muscle \\nprotein synthesis, by itself, it may offer too tran -\\nsient a boost in protein synthesis. Combining \\ncasein protein (which is very slow digesting) with \\nwhey prolongs the length of time that muscle pro-\\ntein is spiked and leads to better long-term gains \\nin muscle growth and strength, as compared to \\nwhey protein alone (Soop et al. 2012; Reidy et al. \\n2014; Reidy et al. 2013; Kerksick 2006).'),\n",

You can do this \\nby buying a separate jug of whey protein and a \\nseparate jug of casein protein and mixing them \\nat about 1:1 ratio. Or you can go for the more \\nconvenient method of buying a protein powder \\nblend that already combines whey and casein. An \\neven easier method is to mix whey protein in about \\n2 cups of low-fat milk or 1 cup of Greek yogurt. \\nBoth milk and Greek yogurt are good sources of \\nmicellar casein and can make the protein powder \\nmuch tastier than mixing it in water.\\nThe most critical times to take this protein blend \\nare within 30 minutes before workouts and within \\n30 minutes after workouts. Shoot for about 20 to \\n40 grams of protein at each dose.\\nAnother crucial time to take a mixed protein \\npowder is as soon as you wake up in the morning. \\nBecause you have been fasting while you sleep, \\nyour muscle protein has been broken down for \\nfuel. By drinking a mixed protein shake of whey \\nand casein, you rebuild the broken-down protein \\nand put your body back in an anabolic state.\\nYou should also have a mixed protein powder \\ncontaining whey and casein immediately before \\nbed. Micellar casein can take up to 7 hours to \\nfully digest. This is because casein literally forms \\na clot when it is in the stomach. To visualize this, \\nconsider when you mix a whey protein powder com-\\npared to when you mix a casein protein powder. \\nThe whey tends to mix very easily yet the casein \\ntends to form clumps in the fluid. This is similar to \\nwhat happens in your stomach when you consume \\ncasein. Although the clumps of casein may be \\nbad for palatability when drinking a casein shake, \\nit provides benefits when these clumps form in \\nyour stomach. These clumps decrease the surface \\narea of the casein that is available to digestive \\nenzymes. The enzymes must digest the casein \\nclumps one layer at a time, much like peeling the \\nlayers of an onion. This means that casein provides \\na slow and steady supply of amino acids for most \\nof the night. That can help to prevent the break -\\ndown of muscle protein while you sleep, helping \\nyou to gain more muscle mass in the long run.\\nGOAL 7: USE DIFFERENT TYPES \\nOF CARBOHYDRATE BEFORE \\nAND AFTER WORKOUTS\\nIt should be obvious that before a workout you \\nwant to provide your body ample fuel to keep your \\nmuscles running as strong as possible for as \\nlong as possible throughout the workout. Having \\na protein shake, as discussed earlier, will help \\nwith those energy needs, as will the supplements \\ndiscussed in goal 8. However, during your workouts \\none of the major fuel sources that your muscles \\nuse is glycogen. Glycogen is the storage form of \\ncarbohydrate. In simplified terms, when you con -\\nsume carbohydrate, most is broken down into or \\nconverted into glucose, which is what blood sugar \\nis. Glucose can either be used fairly immediately \\nfor fuel or it can be stored, mainly in muscle fibers \\nand the liver. It is stored in the form of glycogen, \\nwhich is just long branched chains of glucose \\nconnected together. The glycogen in your muscle \\ncells and liver is broken down into glucose and \\nused as one of the main fuels for your workouts.\\n*    *\\n*\\n500\\n400\\n300\\n200\\n100\\n0\\nTime 0 hr 1 hr 2 hr 3 hr 4 hr 5 hr 6 hr 7 hr\\nA\\nLeucine concentration\\n(μM)\\nFIGURE 27.1 Plasma leucine concentrations after ingestion of whey or casein.\\nReprinted, by permission, from Y .

The best source of such a carb \\nis a low-glycemic carb. Fruit works well because it \\nis a low-glycemic carb and because most fruit is \\nabout half glucose and half fructose. \\nLow glycemic \\nmeans that it doesn’t spike blood glucose levels, \\nwhich then spikes insulin levels. Because when \\ninsulin levels are spiked, it rushes all of the glu -\\ncose into the muscle cells and depletes the levels \\nof glucose in the blood, which puts you in a state \\nof hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). That leaves you \\nlethargic, fatigued, slow, and weak. So when you \\nconsume fruit before a workout, the glucose com-\\nponent of fruit will give your body a small source \\nof quick energy that it can use. But the fructose, \\non the other hand, is low glycemic despite being \\na sugar. This is because the body can’t readily \\nuse the form of sugar that fructose is. So it has \\nto go to the liver, where it gets converted to gly -\\ncogen. Then the liver controls when the glycogen \\nis released into the bloodstream as glucose. This \\nallows fructose to provide longer-lasting energy. \\nSo with fruit you get a small dose of quick energy, \\nbut also longer lasting energy to prevent you from \\ncrashing. Within 30 minutes before workouts con-\\nsume about 20 to 40 grams of carbohydrate from \\nfruit or other low-glycemic carb source along with \\na protein shake.\\nAfter the workout, your best bet is to do the \\nopposite of before the workout and consume a \\nhigh-glycemic carb. At the end of a workout, your \\nmuscle glycogen levels are depleted. If your muscle \\nglycogen levels are not restored, your performance \\nin the next workout can suffer and muscle growth \\nmay be compromised.\\nOne way that muscle growth can be compro -\\nmised is because muscle glycogen levels serve \\nas a barometer for how much energy the body \\nhas stored. If energy levels are low, as it seems \\nwhen muscle glycogen is low, then the muscles \\nmay not want to expend energy-building muscle. \\nBuilding muscle requires energy, and bigger mus-\\ncles require more energy to maintain. If your body \\nis unsure that you have adequate energy to fuel \\nother, more critical processes and to maintain \\nmore muscle mass, it may choose not to go gang-\\nbusters in building muscle.\\nAnother way that muscle growth may be compro-\\nmised by not consuming adequate carbohydrate \\nis because glycogen pulls water into the muscle \\nfibers. The more glycogen, the more water in the \\nmuscle fibers. More water makes the muscles \\nfuller. This makes your muscles appear signifi -\\ncantly bigger. If your muscles are low in glycogen, \\nthen they are also low in water and that means \\nthat they look flatter and smaller than they could. \\nHaving muscles that are fuller due to more glyco-\\ngen and water can also instigate muscle growth. \\nThere is evidence that having more water in the \\nmuscle fibers stretches the muscle membranes, \\nand that stretch instigates chemical pathways that \\nincrease muscle protein synthesis, which can lead \\nto greater muscle growth.\\nThe best way to fully replenish muscle glycogen \\nafter workouts is with high-glycemic (fast-digest -\\ning) carbohydrate. These types of carbohydrate \\nmake it into the bloodstream and to your muscle \\nfibers almost as quickly as you ingest them. The \\nquicker you get carbohydrate to your muscles \\nafter workouts, the faster and better the muscle \\nglycogen replenishment. One of the best sources \\nof fast carbohydrate is dextrose, which is glucose. \\nThis form of sugar requires no digestion and is \\nabsorbed immediately into your bloodstream. \\nYou can use straight dextrose or glucose powder \\nor Pixy Stix (100% dextrose) or gummy bears, \\nwhich tend to be made out of dextrose and corn \\nsyrup. Corn syrup is essentially branched glucose \\nmolecules that are immediately broken down and \\nabsorbed. Corn syrup is completely different from \\nhigh-fructose corn syrup. White bread and white \\npotatoes are also good sources because they \\nare mainly starch, which is branched glucose \\nmolecules bound together that break apart rapidly \\nupon ingestion.\\nThese fast carbs also spike insulin levels. After \\na workout is the one of the rare times of day when \\nyou want to spike the anabolic hormone insulin. \\nInsulin is critical for pushing creatine into muscle \\nfibers. Without a big spike in insulin, creatine \\nuptake is not optimal. Insulin also helps amino \\nacids, such as beta-alanine and BCAAs; the other \\ncritical ones from your protein shake get taken up \\nby the muscle fibers. And let’s not forget about \\nthe glucose from fast carbohydrate, which insulin \\nhelps to gain entry into the muscle fibers. For more \\ninformation on these supplements, see goal 8.\\nHaving fast carbohydrate after workouts is a \\nsweet treat that doesn’t damage your diet. Whether \\nyou are trying to maximize gains in mass or lose fat \\nand gain muscle, you should be following a fairly \\n“clean” diet. That is, doughnuts, French fries, and'),\n",

Having a dose of sweets in the form of dex-\\ntrose, gummy bears, Pixy Stix, or white bread with \\njelly is a great way to get your sweet fix in for the \\nday and actually have it enhance your results. Why \\nwould you ever want to skip that?\\nSome research shows that consuming a protein \\nshake after workouts with or without fast carbs \\nspikes muscle protein synthesis to an equivalent \\nlevel. In other words, adding carbohydrate to a \\nprotein shake postworkout does not increase \\nmuscle protein synthesis any more than the pro -\\ntein shake did alone without carbohydrate. This \\nhas caused some experts to claim that you do not \\nneed carbohydrate after workouts. Well, that’s a bit \\nextreme. It’s true that you can still build muscle \\nwithout having carbohydrate after workouts. But I \\nwouldn’t recommend that unless you are on a very \\nlow-carb diet and you have removed carbohydrate \\nfrom every other meal of your diet. In fact, it makes \\nno sense to eat carbohydrate at other meals but \\navoid eating carbohydrate postworkout. If you are \\neating carbohydrate at any meals, the most critical \\nmeal to eat it is the postworkout meal when it will \\naid in recovery.\\nSome people worry that eating carbohydrate \\npostworkout will blunt growth hormone and tes -\\ntosterone levels after the workout. Here’s what \\nthey don’t understand. Growth hormone and \\ntestosterone levels rise during the workout and \\npeak toward the end of the workout, depending \\non the workout. After the workout, the levels of \\ntheses hormones begin to drop sharply so that \\nthey are back to resting levels about 60 to 90 \\nminutes after the workout is over. The release of \\nthese hormones has already peaked before you \\nconsume the carbohydrate. After the workout it is \\ntoo late for the carbohydrate to have a negative \\neffect on hormone levels.\\nSome people worry that consuming fast carbo-\\nhydrate after workouts will lead to diabetes. This \\nis due to the media’s demonization of all sugar. \\nYes, if you are eating sugar while sitting around \\nall day, it will increase your risk of developing type \\n2 diabetes. But someone who trains regularly is \\nalready preventing the metabolic damage that \\nleads to type 2 diabetes. And right after a work -\\nout is when the carbohydrate goes straight to the \\nmuscles and restocks the muscle glycogen as well \\nas the liver glycogen levels. So there is no risk in \\nconsuming fast carbohydrate after workouts. It’s \\nwhat your body needs.\\nAlthough the amount of fast carbohydrate you \\nconsume after a workout depends on your weight \\nand the intensity and length of the workout, a \\ngeneral recommendation is to shoot for about 20 \\nto 40 grams of fast carbs such as dextrose within \\n30 minutes after the workout is over. Limit the fast \\ncarbs to about 60 grams for two main reasons. The \\nfirst is that for optimal absorption by the intestines, \\n60 to 70 grams of one type of carbohydrate is \\nthe maximum before absorption by the intestines \\nbecomes limited. If you’re consuming more than \\nthis, add some fructose, such as from fruit, to your \\npostworkout meal in addition to the dextrose or \\nglucose. The second reason is that consuming too \\nmuch fast carbohydrate can make you feel terrible \\nafter it’s all been quickly taken up by the liver and \\nmuscles and your blood glucose levels drop. This \\nis known as hypoglycemia and can make you feel \\ndizzy, lethargic, and just lousy in general. If you find \\nthat this happens to you even with smaller amounts \\nof fast carbohydrate, then mix your postworkout \\ncarbohydrate so that you are getting some fast \\nand some slow carbohydrate, such as fruit, oats, \\nwhole-wheat bread, and sweet potatoes.\\nGOAL 8: SUPPLEMENT BEFORE \\nAND AFTER WORKOUTS\\nThe two most critical windows for supplying your \\nbody the nutrients it needs to grow bigger and \\nstronger is the preworkout window and the post -\\nworkout window. Getting the right nutrients right \\nbefore you work out can have a significant impact \\non your muscle strength, energy levels, muscle \\nendurance, and overall intensity of your training. \\nPlus it will prime your body for muscle growth when \\nthe workout is over.\\nTaking in the proper nutrients immediately after \\nthe workout will help to better replenish what was \\nused up during the workout, aid recovery, and allow \\nfor better muscle growth and strength gains.\\nIn addition to protein powder blend and carbo-\\nhydrate before and after workouts, the three criti-\\ncal supplements that you should consider taking \\nbefore and after workouts are BCAAs, creatine, \\nand beta-alanine. Along with the protein and car -\\nbohydrate, these can have a dramatic impact on \\nmuscle growth and strength gains. In fact, research \\nfrom Victoria University (Australia) found that when \\nparticipants consumed whey protein, creatine, and \\nglucose immediately before and after workouts for'),\n",

They also lost \\nbody fat while taking the supplements pre- and \\npostworkout, while the group taking the supple -\\nments in the morning and night lost no body fat. \\nThe pre- and postworkout supplement group also \\nhad significantly higher muscle glycogen levels, \\nwhich is critical for performance and muscle growth.\\nbranched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)—The BCAAs \\nare the three amino acids leucine, isoleucine, \\nand valine. These amino acids are critical to take \\nbefore and after workouts because of their ability \\nto boost energy, reduce fatigue, and instigate \\nmuscle growth.\\nSupplementing with BCAAs before exercise \\npromotes muscle endurance and blunts fatigue. \\nOne reason for this is the fact that the BCAAs, \\nunlike most other amino acids, are used directly \\nby the muscle fibers as an energy source. This is \\nespecially true during intense exercise, such as \\nweight training.\\nAnother way the BCAAs keep you energized \\nduring workouts is thanks to valine. During exer -\\ncise tryptophan is taken up by the brain in large \\namounts. Tryptophan is converted in the brain to \\n5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), or what you likely know \\nbetter as serotonin. Having higher serotonin during \\nexercise signals the brain that the body is fatigued. \\nThis leads to a reduction in muscle strength and \\nendurance. Valine competes with tryptophan for \\nentry into the brain and typically wins. This means \\nthat less tryptophan gets in and gets converted to \\nserotonin, which allows your muscles to contract \\nwith more force for a longer time before getting \\nfatigued. This also can help you to stay more alert \\nand keep your brain sharper during the day when \\nyou are not exercising.\\nAfter workouts you want another dose of BCAAs \\nbecause they are the most critical amino acids for \\nmuscle growth. Leucine is the key player here; it \\nhas one of the most critical roles in muscle growth. \\nLeucine acts much like a key does to an ignition \\nof a car. The car in this case is a muscle cell or \\nfiber. The ignition turns on the process of muscle \\nprotein synthesis, which builds up the muscle \\nprotein that leads to muscle growth. In more sci -\\nentific terms, leucine activates a complex called \\nmTOR, which ramps up muscle protein synthesis \\nand therefore muscle growth. Those who add extra \\nleucine to postworkout protein and carbohydrate \\nhave significantly greater muscle protein synthesis \\nthan those just getting protein and carbohydrate.\\nAnother way that leucine acts as a potent ana-\\nbolic agent is by spiking insulin levels. Much like \\neating high-glycemic carbs, leucine increases the \\nrelease of insulin from the pancreas, which helps \\nto drive it into the muscle cells where it can work \\nto stimulate muscle growth. Insulin also encour -\\nages muscles’ growth itself by encouraging greater \\nmuscle protein synthesis and decreasing muscle \\nprotein breakdown.\\nTake a 5- to 10-gram dose of BCAAs within 30 \\nminutes before workouts and another 5 to 10 \\ngrams of BCAAs within 30 minutes after workouts. \\nEven though whey protein, which you will also take \\nat these points, is rich in BCAAs, taking extra \\nBCAAs in their free form can get them to your \\nmuscles faster and ensure that you have ample \\nBCAAs at the time they are most critical.\\ncreatine—Both clinical data and anecdotal evi -\\ndence suggest that creatine provides the best \\nresults when taken before and after workouts. \\nThe main reason to get a dose of creatine before \\nworkouts is that it provides the muscle fibers with \\na powerful energy source. Once inside the muscle \\nfibers, creatine gains a high-energy phosphate to \\nform phosphocreatine (PCr). Phosphocreatine is \\nsimply a molecule of creatine with a phosphate \\ngroup attached to it. During very high-intensity \\nexercise, such as weightlifting, creatine donates \\nthis high-energy phosphate group to the muscle \\nto form ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This rap-\\nidly generated ATP fuels the muscle contractions \\nduring a set. The more phosphocreatine you have \\nstored in your muscle fibers, the more reps you \\ncan get during a set. This is the main way that \\nsupplementing with creatine leads to greater \\ngains in muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy \\nover time. It allows you to complete more reps \\nwith a given weight. That eventually allows you to \\nlift heavier and heavier weight. And that greater \\noverload placed on the muscle in combination \\nwith greater work performed eventually leads to \\ngreater muscle growth. Getting a dose of creatine \\nbefore workouts ensures that your levels of phos-\\nphocreatine in the muscle fibers are maximized.\\nSupplementing with creatine leads to significant \\ngains in muscle strength and power as well as \\nmuscle growth.

Another study by Noonan and colleagues \\n(1998) found that trained collegiate football \\nplayers taking creatine while following an 8-week \\nweight training program had a 6 percent increase \\nin their one-rep bench press strength, while those \\ntaking a placebo had no strength gains at all. A \\n2003 review by Rawson and Volek on creatine \\nreported that out of 16 studies investigating the \\neffects of creatine on one-rep max strength, the \\naverage increase in strength was about 10 per -\\ncent more in those taking creatine than in those \\ntaking a placebo.\\nStudies also show that creatine enables people \\nto complete more reps with a given weight. Com-\\npetitive powerlifters taking creatine while preparing \\nfor a competition increased the number of reps \\nthey were able to complete with 85 percent of \\ntheir one-rep max by 40 percent, while those taking \\na placebo had no change in the number of reps \\nthey were able to complete with the same weight \\n(Kelly and Jenkins, 1998). Rawson and Volek \\n(2003) determined that out of the 16 studies they \\nreviewed, the average increase in reps performed \\nwhile taking creatine was about 15 percent more \\nthan for those taking a placebo. Figure 27.2 shows \\nthe average percent increase in muscle strength \\nand repetitions completed when participants sup-\\nplemented with creatine as compared to a placebo.\\nMost of the studies performed on creatine \\nindicate that supplementing with it significantly \\nenhances athletic ability because it produces \\nhigher muscle force and power during short bouts \\nof exercise. The participants in these studies had \\nmixed athletic ability and training status, from rela-\\ntively untrained novices to competitive college-level \\nathletes. Some of the exercise performances that \\nare improved include various types of short-term \\nand all-out cycling, sprinting, repeated jumping, \\nswimming, soccer, kayaking, rowing, and of course \\nweightlifting, which was discussed previously. The \\ngreatest improvements in athletic performance \\nseem to be found during a series of repetitive high-\\npower output exercise bouts. For example, after \\na short rest period (20-60 seconds) after a short \\nsprint, speed may be increased on the second bout \\nof sprinting. Athletic performance during these \\nlatter bouts of exercise can be increased by 5 to \\n20 percent with creatine over the placebo group. \\nThis means that athletes in sports such as football \\nand soccer, in which continuous play typically lasts \\nfor only a few seconds, can expect a significant \\nboost in performance from creatine.\\nSeveral studies show that creatine significantly \\nboosts lean muscle mass. Kelly and Jenkins \\n(1998), as noted earlier, found that the power -\\nlifters taking creatine gained an average of over \\n6 pounds of lean body weight; some participants \\ngained up to 11 pounds of lean body weight in less \\nthan 4 weeks, while those taking a placebo had \\n16%\\n14%\\n12%\\n10%\\n8%\\n6%\\n4%\\n2%\\n0%\\nOne-rep max strength Number of reps completed\\nFIGURE 27.2 Percent increase in strength and reps completed when supplementing with creatine versus a placebo.\\nSource: E.S.

Becque and colleagues \\n(2000) reported that trained weightlifters taking \\ncreatine gained almost 5 pounds of lean body \\nweight in 6 weeks, while those taking a placebo \\nhad no change in body weight. Since creatine sup-\\nplementation likely does not increase bone mass \\nor organ mass, the increase in lean body weight \\nis more reasonably the result of a gain in muscle \\nmass. In these short periods a good deal of that \\ngain in muscle mass likely comes from water, \\nbecause the muscle fibers gain a higher volume of \\nfluid when stocked with higher levels of creatine. \\nHowever, that can lead to long-term muscle growth \\nvia greater protein synthesis. Figure 27.3 shows \\nthe average increase in lean body weight (muscle \\nmass) in pounds that participants gained while \\ntaking creatine and following a weight training \\nprogram. Both studies found no change in lean \\nbody weight in those taking a placebo.\\nThe majority of benefits from creatine involve \\nits ability to supply fast energy during workouts. \\nThis allows you to recover faster between bouts \\nof exercise, such as fast running or weightlifting. \\nBut today we know that creatine works through a \\nnumber of mechanisms, one of which is through \\nmuscle cell volumization. This is a fancy term \\nthat means the muscle cells fill up with water. \\nSince creatine is essentially a protein, it draws \\nwater from the blood and the space outside of the \\nmuscle cells (known as the interstitial fluid) into \\nthe muscle through the process of osmosis. This \\nis the major reason for the rapid weight gain that \\nis associated with creatine supplementation in the \\nearly stages of supplementation. However, this \\nincrease in cell volume causes the cell membranes \\nto stretch, which is thought to initiate long-term \\nincreases in muscle growth and strength through \\ngreater protein synthesis—the method that muscle \\ncells use to grow.\\nAnother way that creatine has been found to \\nwork is by increasing the number of satellite \\ncells in muscle fibers. Satellite cells are basically \\nmuscle stem cells, and one way that muscles grow \\nbigger and stronger is by the addition of muscle \\nsatellite cells to existing muscle fibers. A 2006 \\nstudy by Olsen and colleagues found that after \\n8 weeks of supplementing with creatine while \\nfollowing a weight training program, participants \\nhad almost 100 percent more satellite cells in \\ntheir muscle fibers than those taking a placebo. \\nAs expected, the greater number of satellite cells \\nwas associated with greater muscle size. This can \\nalso lead to greater muscle strength and power.\\nCreatine also appears to work through increases \\nin insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). IGF-I is critical \\nin initiating processes in muscle cells that lead \\nto enhanced muscle growth and muscle strength. \\nBurke (2008) reported that weight-trained partici-\\npants taking creatine while following a weightlifting \\nprogram for 8 weeks had significantly higher IGF-I \\ncontent in their muscle fibers than those taking \\na placebo.\\nAnother way that creatine appears to work is by \\ninhibiting myostatin.

Myostatin \\nis a protein that limits muscle growth. The Iranian \\nresearchers concluded that since myostatin levels \\nwere lower in the participants taking creatine, one \\nway that creatine may work to increase muscle size \\nand strength is by reducing myostatin levels, which \\nreduces the limitation that this protein places on \\nmuscle growth.\\nAlthough there is ample research showing that \\ncreatine is safe for almost anyone at any age to \\nuse, there are still myths regarding safety and side \\neffects. One of the longest-standing myths is that \\ncreatine can cause muscle cramps. Numerous stud-\\nies debunk this claim. Greenwood and colleagues \\n(2003b) concluded that NCAA football players taking \\ncreatine over the course of 3 years had no increase \\nin incidence of muscle cramps or muscle injures. In \\nfact, another 2003 study found that NCAA football \\nplayers taking creatine for one full season actually \\nhad a significant reduction in muscle cramps and \\nmuscle injuries (Greenwood et al. 2003a).\\nAnother misconception about creatine is that \\nit can lead to impaired liver and kidney function. \\nStudies done in the 1990s were some of the first \\nto show that short-term creatine supplementation \\ndoes not impair kidney function in healthy adults \\n(Poortmans et al. 1997; Poortmans and Francaux \\n1999). Another study (Cancela et al. 2008) has \\nfurther shown that 8 weeks of creatine supple -\\nmentation in football (soccer) athletes had no \\neffect on health markers that included kidney and \\nliver function. Longer-term studies have also been \\ndone to confirm creatine’s safety. Mayhew and \\ncolleagues (2002) concluded that NCAA football \\nplayers taking creatine for up to about 6 years \\nhad no long-term detrimental effects on overall \\nhealth or kidney or liver functions. In another \\nstudy (Kreider et al. 2003) NCAA football players \\ntaking creatine for close to 2 years exhibited no \\nnegative effects on general health or kidney and \\nliver function. The most recent study (Lugaresi et \\nal. 2013) involved weight-trained participants who \\nwere following a high-protein diet (0.6-1.5 grams of \\nprotein per pound of body weight) and consumed 5 \\ngrams of creatine for 1 year. Kidney function was \\nnot compromised.\\nInstead of being detrimental to your health, cre-\\natine actually provides numerous health benefits. \\nBecause phosphocreatine is important for energy \\nproduction involved in nerve cell function, creatine \\nhas been shown to provide numerous benefits \\nto the brain and the rest of the nervous system. \\nFor example, research has found that creatine \\nsupplementation enhances cognitive function and \\nmemory and may help in the treatment of Parkin-\\nson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and even \\ndepression. It may also protect against brain injury.\\nCreatine has also been found to aid cardio -\\nvascular health, such as improvement of symptoms \\nin those with congestive heart failure, and may \\neven lower cholesterol levels. One study (Earnest \\net al. 1996) discovered that male and female par-\\nticipants taking creatine for 8 weeks had a drop \\nof more than 5 percent in total cholesterol and a \\ndrop in LDL cholesterol (the bad type of cholesterol) \\nof more than 20 percent. Similarly, researchers \\nreported that 28 days of creatine supplementation \\ndecreased total cholesterol by 10 percent in healthy \\nyoung males (Arciero et al. 2001). And healthy \\nyoung males taking creatine plus a multivitamin \\nsupplement significantly reduced their levels of \\nhomocysteine (an amino acid associated with \\nheart disease), compared to those taking just the \\nmultivitamin supplement (Korzun 2004).\\nSo be sure to get a dose of creatine before work-\\nouts to ensure that your levels of it in the muscle \\ncells are maximized. And get another dose after \\nworkouts, when it will be preferentially taken up by \\nthe muscle cells, and replenish any that was lost \\nduring the workout. How much you take pre- and \\npostworkout depends on the form of creatine you \\nuse. If you go with creatine monohydrate, take 3 \\nto 5 grams before and after workouts. Although \\ncreatine monohydrate is the most studied form of \\ncreatine, creatine hydrochloride is a form of cre -\\natine that I have worked with extensively. It tends to \\nbe absorbed better than creatine monohydrate and \\ncauses less stomach distress. If using this form, \\ntake 1.5 to 2 grams before and after workouts.\\nbeta-alanine—A nonessential amino acid that is \\nproduced naturally in the liver. You also get it in \\nyour diet from meat sources, such as beef and \\npoultry. In the body, beta-alanine, whether from \\nthe liver or ingested from food or supplements, is \\ntaken up by the muscle fibers and combines with \\nthe amino acid histidine to form the dipeptide \\n(two-amino-acid protein) carnosine. Carnosine \\nprovides all the benefits associated with beta-al-\\nanine, which include greater strength and power, \\nbetter endurance, and even greater fat loss and \\nmuscle growth.\\nCarnosine works by increasing the muscle’s \\nbuffering capacity of hydrogen (H+) ions, which'),\n",

This \\nincreases the muscle’s ability to maintain stronger \\ncontractions for longer periods during exercise. In \\nother words, you can lift more weight and complete \\nmore reps during the later stages of your workouts. \\nAnd this ability leads to greater gains in strength \\nand power, as well as muscle mass, while also \\npromoting greater fat loss.\\nParticipants taking just over 4 grams of beta-ala-\\nnine per day for 30 days were able to increase the \\nnumber of reps they could complete during a squat \\nworkout by almost 25 percent more than those \\ntaking a placebo (Hoffman et al. 2008). Another \\nstudy found that 4 weeks of beta-alanine supple -\\nmentation in amateur boxers increased their average \\npunching power in the last 10 seconds of simulated \\n3-minute rounds by 2000 percent more than those \\ntaking a placebo (Donovan et al. 2012). The ability \\nto maintain punching power late in the round is \\nsimilar to the ability to maintain more strength and \\npower later in workouts, meaning you can lift more \\nweight for more reps. The most recent study, found \\nthat soldiers taking beta-alanine for four weeks \\nincreased jumping power and even marksmanship. \\nThis suggests not only a muscle performance benefit \\nof beta-alanine, but also possible improved psycho-\\nmotor performance (Hoffman et al. 2014).\\nResearch also shows a great synergy of beta-al-\\nanine with creatine. One study reported that \\nweight-trained athletes consuming 3.2 grams of \\nbeta-alanine plus 10 grams of creatine daily for \\n12 weeks gained significantly more muscle mass \\nwhile simultaneously losing significant body fat, \\nas compared to those taking just 10 grams of cre-\\natine alone and those taking a placebo (Hoffman \\net al. 2006). Both the creatine-only group and the \\nplacebo group did not lose any body fat. \\nThe absolute lowest amount of beta-alanine \\nconsumed to provide the benefits listed previously \\nis 1.6 grams per day. However, research on various \\nlevels of supplementation shows that around 2 \\ngrams per day or 4 grams per day each may provide \\neven better benefits. Since the uptake of nutrients \\nsuch as amino acids beta-alanine is improved \\naround workouts, I recommend getting a dose of \\nbeta-alanine preworkout and postworkout. Blood \\nlevels of beta-alanine peak within 30 minutes of \\nsupplementing with it, and it completely leaves the \\ncirculation within 3 hours of consuming. So it makes \\nsense to get about a 2-gram dose of beta-alanine \\nboth before workouts and then immediately after.\\nGOAL 9: COVER YOUR VITAMIN \\n AND MINERAL NEEDS \\nWITH A SUPPLEMENT\\nAthletes and those who train intensely lose many \\ncritical vitamins and minerals, such as B vitamins, \\nvitamin C, chromium, selenium, zinc, magnesium, \\nand copper. This is due to a variety of factors, such \\nas loss of the minerals in sweat and urine, as well \\nas increased use for energy production during \\nthe workout and recovery and protein synthesis \\nafter training.\\nEven if you were careful to eat a well-rounded \\ndiet, you may not be getting adequate amounts \\nof critical micronutrients. That’s because our \\nfood supply today is lower in many of these vita -\\nmins and minerals due to conventional farming \\npractices, such as overfarming, which dwindles \\nthe nutrient density of the soil. And the grain \\nfeeding of conventional cattle and chickens also \\ndwindles the micronutrient content of milk, beef, \\neggs, and chicken. Plus certain foods inhibit the \\nabsorption of some micronutrients. Refined sugar, \\nas well as white-flour products (like white bread), \\ncan lower blood levels of minerals, such as zinc \\nand magnesium. Foods rich in calcium (such as \\ndairy products) inhibit absorption of both zinc and \\nmagnesium by the small intestine. Foods rich in \\nphytates (phosphorous compounds found in whole-\\ngrain breads, cereals, and legumes) also hinder the \\nabsorption of zinc by the small intestine.\\nNumerous studies also show that vitamin and \\nmineral supplements reduce the risk of certain dis-\\neases and death. The most recent was from Li and \\ncolleagues (2012). The researchers reported that \\nin about 24,000 people, those taking vitamin and \\nmineral supplements at the start of the study had a \\n42 percent reduced risk of all-cause mortality over \\nthe 11 years of the study and a 48 percent reduced \\nrisk of cancer-related death. A 2012 study by \\nArul and colleagues suggests that supplementing \\nwith a multivitamin could reduce the risk of colon \\ncancer. A study reported that supplementing with \\nmultivitamins, especially those including vitamins \\nA, C, and E, reduced the risk of colon cancer (Park \\net al. 2010). Another study reported that women \\nusing multivitamins had a 30 percent reduced risk \\nof heart attack (Rautiainen et al. 2010). A 2009 \\nstudy by Pocobelli and colleagues suggests that \\nmultivitamin use over 10 years reduces the risk'),\n",

Xu and \\ncolleagues (2009) reported that women taking a \\nmultivitamin supplement have a younger biological \\nage based on telomere length compared to those \\nnot supplementing. And a study reported that \\ntaking selenium along with a multivitamin reduced \\nthe risk of prostate cancer by 40 percent (Peters \\net al. 2007). A study found that in 130 adults, \\nthose taking a multivitamin and mineral supple -\\nment for 1 year had significantly less infection, \\nsuch as respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary \\ntract infections and influenza, and a lower rate of \\nillness-related absenteeism, than those receiving \\na placebo (Barringer et al. 2003).\\nThe bottom line is that you definitely should be \\nusing a multivitamin and mineral supplement to \\nboost overall health, brain function, athletic per -\\nformance, and even fat loss and muscle recovery \\nand growth. Your best bet is to take your multivi -\\ntamin with your first meal of the day to enhance \\nabsorption of most of the nutrients and to stock \\nup on them for your day ahead.\\nLook for a multivitamin that provides as close \\nto 100 percent as possible of the daily value (DV) \\nof the following:\\n• Vitamin A (only if it is mostly beta-carotene; \\notherwise keep it under 4000 IU)\\n• Vitamins B 1 (thiamin), B 2 (riboflavin), B 3 \\n(niacin), B6, B12, and folic acid (B9)\\n• Vitamin C\\n• Chromium\\n• Copper\\n• Iodine (especially if you follow a low-sodium \\ndiet)\\n• Iron\\n• Manganese\\n• Selenium\\nDon’t worry about the amount of calcium in your \\nmultivitamin. In fact, because calcium interferes \\nwith the absorption of other minerals such as \\nzinc and magnesium, the less calcium the better. \\nYou should take a calcium supplement separate \\nfrom when you take a multivitamin. Don’t worry \\ntoo much about the amount of zinc or magnesium \\nsince you should take them separately from a \\nmultivitamin anyway.\\nConsider getting more than the DV , or likely \\nwhat’s in your multivitamin, of the following vita -\\nmins and minerals:\\n• B vitamins: These water-soluble vitamins \\nare typically low in those who train. They are \\noften lost in sweat. Take a B-complex 100 \\nthat provides 100 milligrams of B1, B2, B3, \\npantothenic acid (B5), and B6 and at least \\n100 micrograms of B 12, 400 micrograms \\nof folic acid, and 300 micrograms of biotin \\nonce or twice a day.\\n• Vitamin C: This is also a water-soluble \\nvitamin that can be lost in sweat. Take 250 \\nto 500 milligrams of vitamin C once a day.\\n• Vitamin D: This vitamin is critical for your \\nhealth, physique, and performance. It aids \\nfat loss, testosterone levels, bone health, \\nand mood. Take 2000 to 6000 IU of vitamin \\nD3 per day.\\n• Vitamin E: New research shows that vitamin \\nE is critical for muscle recovery. Unless your \\nmultivitamin has at least 400 IU of E, you \\nwill want to take a vitamin E supplement \\nproviding 400 to 800 IU per day. Be sure \\nto buy the natural forms, called d-alpha-to-\\ncopherols, which are absorbed and used \\nbetter than the synthetic forms, called \\ndl-alpha tocopherols.\\n• Calcium: Important for bone health, fat \\nloss, and even testosterone levels, calcium \\nin the amount of 1000 to 2000 milligrams \\nper day is required. Take 500 to 600 mil -\\nligrams of calcium (any more may not get \\nabsorbed properly) one or two times per \\nday (depending on how much calcium you \\nget from your diet) separately from other \\nminerals and vitamins.\\n• Zinc and magnesium: Get 30 milligrams \\nof zinc and 450 milligrams of magnesium \\n30 to 60 minutes before bedtime. It will \\nhelp increase sleep quality and keep your \\ntestosterone levels and muscle strength \\nup. An easy way to do this is to take a ZMA \\nsupplement.\\n• For any vitamin or mineral that does not \\nadd up to 100% DV in your multivitamin, \\nconsider taking as a separate supplement \\nto keep your bases covered, unless you \\nare certain to get adequate amounts of the \\nnutrient in your daily diet.'),\n",

That means a reduction to \\nabout 3,000 calories, 260 grams of protein, 290 \\ngrams of carbohydrate, and 85 grams of fat. For a \\n180-pounder, that equates to about 17 calories, \\na bit under 1.5 grams of protein, a bit over 1.6 \\ngrams of carbohydrate, and just under 0.5 gram \\nof fat per pound. These sample diets will work \\nwell as a starting point for those weighing 160 \\nto 200 pounds. If you weigh significantly less or \\nmore than this range, modify the macronutrients \\nand calories for your body weight.'),\n",

The guidelines discussed in chapter 27 are \\nthe same guidelines you want to follow to maximize \\nfat loss. After all, when you talk about dropping \\nbody fat, you still want to at least maintain, if not \\nbuild, lean muscle mass and muscle strength. And \\nusing the programs in chapter 13 along with the \\ninformation in chapter 27 and 28, you can.\\nWhile chapter 27 broke down the nutrition \\nguidelines into goals, chapter 28 breaks down \\nthe nutrition information to maximize fat loss \\ninto steps. That’s because fat loss is a continual \\nprocess, and your diet must change gradually \\nover time. The worst thing that you can do is to \\nimmediately jump down to a very low-calorie and \\nlow-carbohydrate diet. For example, many people \\nask me if going on a keto diet where almost all \\ncarbohydrate is removed from the diet is a smart \\nplan. The answer is no. Yes, it can result in very \\nrapid fat loss at the beginning of the diet. But \\nafter a couple of months or less, when the fat loss \\nstops and they hit a plateau, they have little wiggle \\nroom to remove more calories from their diet and \\ncontinue losing body fat.\\nWhen you diet, your body responds by going into \\nstarvation mode. That basically means that your \\nbody slows down your metabolic rate, which is the \\nnumber of calories you burn just sitting around. \\nThe reason for this is to conserve energy stores, \\nnamely your body fat. Your body prefers to not be \\nlean, since body fat is stored energy that it can rely \\non in times of food scarcity. In developed countries, \\nfood scarcity is obviously not a real threat for most \\npeople. But your body has developed this process \\nshould there be a time when food is scarce. So \\nonce you reduce your caloric intake, your body \\nreacts by slowing down your metabolic rate. The \\ngreater you reduce your caloric intake, the bigger \\nthe drop in your metabolic rate and the quicker \\nthis will happen.\\nTo prevent a massive slowing of your metabolic \\nrate, you need to gradually reduce your caloric \\nintake little by little. Of course, exercise will help \\nto keep your metabolic rate higher, but it cannot \\nprevent the gradual reduction of it as you reduce \\ncalories. So you actually want to start a diet for fat \\nloss by eating as many calories as you can while \\nstill losing weight. This way you will have ample \\nroom to keep reducing calories as your metabolic \\nrate drops and fat loss hits a plateau. This way \\nyou can keep losing body fat. Figure out how many \\ncalories to start your diet with by reading through \\nstep 1: analyze your diet.\\nSTEPPING UP FAT LOSS\\nFollowing are the eight steps you want to follow \\nto maximize fat loss while building muscle and \\nstrength or, at the very least, maintaining muscle \\nmass.\\nStep 1: Analyze Your Diet\\nTo get the best estimate of where you should start \\nfor calories, you will need to take an honest look at \\nyour current diet. I typically recommend recording \\neverything you eat for one full week. But if that \\nseems daunting, do at least two weekdays and \\none weekend day. If you have a scale, weigh food \\nsuch as chicken, beef, and fish. For liquids and \\ngrains like rice and cereal, use measuring cups and \\nmeasuring spoons. Or if you have a good take on'),\n",

For packaged foods, use the nutrition \\nfacts label on the box; for other foods, use a reli-\\nable source, such as USDA site. The direct link to \\ntheir food database is http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/\\nndb/search/list.\\nIt’s important that you do not alter your typical \\ndiet when you record your food intake. One trick \\nthat we use to keep people from steering astray \\nfrom a diet is to have them record everything they \\neat. When they have a weak moment and crave \\ndoughnuts, knowing that they have to record that in \\na food log helps them avoid eating the doughnuts. \\nBut during this week, do not avoid eating any of the \\nfoods that you normally do. The point is to assess \\nyour true current diet so that you know where to \\nstart your new diet. If you alter it, it can actually \\nwork against your fat-loss efforts.\\nCalculate the amount of calories, grams of pro-\\ntein, grams of carbohydrate, and grams of total fat \\nfor each food that you eat. Then add these up for \\nall the foods that you eat each day. Once you have \\nthe total amount of calories and grams of protein, \\ncarbohydrate, and fat for each day, you need to get \\nan average of all the days. So if you recorded 7 \\ndays of food intake, then add the calories up for \\nall 7 days and divide this number by 7 to get the \\naverage caloric intake for the 7 days. If you did just \\n3 days, then obviously you would add up the total \\ncalories for the 3 days and divide by 3. Do this \\nalso for grams of protein, grams of carbohydrate, \\nand grams of fat. But the critical factor is your \\naverage caloric intake. Take your average caloric \\nintake and divide it by your body weight in pounds \\nto calculate your average calories relative to your \\nbody weight. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds \\nand you consumed an average of 4,000 calories \\nper day, you currently consume an average of 20 \\ncalories per pound of body weight.\\nStep 2: Build Your Initial Diet\\nUsing the muscle building guidelines in chapter \\n27, the most critical goals that you want to focus \\non to build your initial diet are goal 1 (focus on \\nprotein) and goal 2 (get ample fat). Start your diet \\nby making sure that you consume 1.5 grams of \\nprotein per pound of body weight and 0.5 gram \\nof fat per pound. Since there are 4 calories per \\ngram of protein, that means that you will con -\\nsume 6 calories from protein per pound of body \\nweight. Since fat has about 9 calories per gram, \\nyou will be consuming 4.5 calories from fat per \\npound of body weight. Adding the calories from \\nprotein and the calories from fat equates to 10.5 \\ncalories per pound of body weight. Subtract 10.5 \\ncalories from 20 calories (the number of calo -\\nries per pound of body weight you currently eat), \\nwhich equals 9.5 calories. This is the number of \\ncalories you can consume from carbohydrate per \\npound of body weight. Since there are 4 calories \\nper gram of carbohydrate, that equals about 2.5 \\ngrams. Round down to 2 grams of carbohydrate \\nper pound of body weight. So your new diet will \\nconsist of about 1.5 grams of protein, 2 grams of \\ncarbohydrate, 0.5 gram of fat, and 18.5 calories \\nper pound of body weight. For the 200-pounder, \\nthat equates to 3,700 calories, 300 grams of pro-\\ntein, 400 grams of carbohydrate, and 100 grams \\nof fat per day. See sample diet for a 200-pound \\nperson following these guidelines in tables 28.1, \\n28.2, 28.3, or 28.4 based on when you work out. \\nNote that the sample meal plans in this chapter \\nare very similar for reasons of illustrating how \\nto change the diet when you move through the \\nsteps. This does not mean that you should eat \\nthe same foods every day and the same foods in \\neach step of the diet. Quite the contrary. You want \\nto have as much variety in your diet as possible. \\nFor food alternatives to replace the foods in the \\nsample diets, refer to the food alternatives list \\nin appendix B.\\nFollow this diet for as long as you continue \\nlosing fat. Note that you will likely gain muscle \\nmass even though you are dropping body fat. So \\ndo not use the scale as your major indicator of \\nfat loss. Use the mirror and waist size or the fit of \\nthe waist on your pants. An even better option is \\nto have your body fat professionally measured by \\na seven-site skinfold caliper, underwater weighing, \\nor DEXA scan. Do not use bioelectrical impedance, \\nwhich calculates percent body fat on how fast it \\ntakes a current to travel through your body. That \\nmethod is not accurate.\\nThe sample meals are for workout days. On \\nrest days, skip the postworkout meal and have \\nthe preworkout meal as a snack.'),\n",

Since you want \\nto keep protein and fat where they are to maximize \\nmuscle growth and strength gains, your best bet \\nis to whittle away at your carb intake. Each time \\nyou hit a plateau in your diet and it seems like you \\nhave not made any progress in losing fat for at least \\na week, it’s time to reduce carbohydrate. You will \\nreduce carbohydrate by 0.25 gram per pound of \\nbody weight each time you need to cut again. That \\nwill reduce your total caloric intake by about 1 cal-\\norie per pound of body weight. So for a 200-pound \\nperson, that equates to about a 200-calorie cut.\\nBecause our sample 200-pounder is currently \\nconsuming 2 grams of carbohydrate per pound of \\nbody weight, his first cut will be bring him down to \\n1.75 grams per pound of body weight. Where you \\nstart reducing your carbohydrate depends on when \\nyou train. But regardless of when you train, you will \\ncut postworkout carbohydrate absolutely last. For \\nthose who train first thing in the morning, start \\nreducing carbohydrate from the end of the day and \\nworking up as you continue to drop. For those who \\ntrain at night, start reducing your carbohydrate from \\nthe start of the day and work down as you continue \\nto cut. It gets a little trickier, if you train at lunch \\nor before dinner. This will bounce around from end \\nto end a bit. See the sample diets for guidelines \\non dropping carbohydrate from your diet with each \\n0.25-gram-per-pound cut.\\nYou will progressively cut carbohydrate each time \\nfat loss hits a plateau until you are down to around \\njust 0.25 gram of carbohydrate per pound. That is, if \\nyou ever have to get that low. Many will not have to get \\nanywhere close to that.

Once carbohydrate drops to 0.5 gram per \\npound of body weight, it is advisable to include a \\nhigher-carbohydrate day every week or so. This can \\nhelp to keep your metabolic rate higher despite the \\nfact that carbohydrate and caloric intake is so low. \\nPlus, it works well as an incentive to get through the \\nweek. Knowing that you have a higher-carb day to look \\nforward to helps you make it through the low-carb \\nperiod. Most people find that they better police them-\\nselves during the low-carbohydrate days so that they \\ncan feel like they earned the high-carb day. Once you \\nhave enjoyed the higher-carb day and enjoyed some \\nof the food you were craving, like bread and pasta, \\nit’s easier to go back to the lower-carbohydrate diet.\\nIt doesn’t matter what day of the week your \\nhigh-carbohydrate day is, but you don’t want to \\ngo any less frequent than about every 7 days. A \\nweekend day works best for most people, but any \\nday of the week will work. Protein and fat should \\nstay about the same; however, you can drop them \\nsomewhat on your higher-carbohydrate day. But \\ndon’t allow protein to drop much lower than 1 gram \\nper pound of body weight, and don’t allow fat to go \\nany lower than 0.25 gram per pound. You should \\nshoot for about 2 grams of carbohydrate per pound \\nof body weight on your high-carb day. That’s about \\n400 grams for the 200-pounder.\\nYour best options for high-carbohydrate foods are \\nlow-glycemic or slow-digesting carbohydrate, such \\nas oatmeal, whole-wheat breads and pastas, and \\nsweet potatoes. However, if you train on your high-\\ncarb day, then you should still consume high-glyce-\\nmic carbohydrate immediately after the workout. \\nWhile the majority of your carboh ydrate should \\ncome from low-GI carbohydrate, you can enjoy some \\nhigh-GI carbohydrate throughout the day.

After \\nall, you still need vegetables. And although they \\nprovide a good deal of fiber, they also provide real \\nnet carbohydrate. Some experts recommend not \\ncounting carbohydrate from vegetables as part of \\nyour daily total of carbohydrate due to the high fiber \\ncontent of most vegetables. Yet the carbohydrate \\ncontent of most vegetables is less than 50 percent \\nfiber. So if you’re eating a lot of vegetables, this \\ncan add up. Instead, I prefer to count even fiber \\nas part of daily carb intake, but realizing that at \\nthe lowest point, carb intake will still be a good \\n30 to 60 grams depending on the diet, or roughly \\nabout 0.25 gram per pound of body weight. Small \\namounts of carbohydrate are also in most protein \\nshakes. And since you need to rely on it to maxi-\\nmize your results in the gym, you’ll need to leave \\nroom for it in your diet. The bottom line is that at \\nthe lowest point, you can never truly get to zero \\ngrams of carbohydrate.\\nRemember that during this phase of the diet, you \\nshould definitely include one high-carbohydrate day \\neach week as discussed in step 4. Having this high-\\ncarb day to look forward to will make a difference \\nin your ability to tolerate such extremes in dieting.\\nYou can find sample meals for making the \\nfinal cut in carbohydrate from 0.5 to 0.25 \\ngram per pound of body weight (or 50 grams \\nof carbohydrate total for the 200-pounder) \\nat \\nwww.humankinetics.com/products/\\nall-products/Jim-Stoppanis-Encyclopedia-of-  \\nMuscle--Strength-2nd-edition. This drops calories \\nto about 10 per pound of body w eight or about \\n2,000 for the 200-pound sample person. Protein \\nand fat stay steady as they have throughout. \\nRemember that these meal plans are based on \\nworkout days. On rest days, skip the postworkout \\nmeal and have the preworkout meal as a snack.\\nStep 6: Switch to Intermittent \\nFasting (IF)\\nOnce you get down to 0.25 gram of carbohydrate \\nper pound of body weight, it’s next to impossi -\\nble to go any lower in carbohydrate. This small \\namount of carboh ydrate is coming from protein \\nsources and vegetables. If you get this low in \\ncarbohydrate and hit a plateau, then there is a \\nvery good chance that it is because you are at \\nextremely low levels of body fat but want to get \\neven lower. For men, this would be somewhere \\naround 5 percent; for women it is somewhere \\naround 12 percent. To keep losing body fat, you \\ncould continue by dropping protein and fat, but \\nthat could compromise muscle mass. So an alter-\\nnative to try first is intermittent fasting.\\nIntermittent fasting is a technique where you \\nfast for a good portion of the day and then you \\nhave a window of time where you can eat. The type \\nof intermittent fasting that I have found to work \\nbest for losing body fat and maintaining muscle is \\n16/8 intermittent fasting. That means that you fast \\nfor 16 hours and your feeding window is 8 hours. \\nFor the average person, the time of day you fast \\nand the time of day you eat make no difference. \\nHowever, those who work out should manipulate \\ntheir fasting and feeding windows based on when \\nthey train.\\nIf you train in the morning, then I suggest that \\nyou start your 8-hour feeding window with your \\npostworkout meal. That means that you would \\ntrain completely fasted and your first meal would \\nbe your postworkout shake. But since you skipped \\nyour preworkout shake, your postworkout shake \\nshould include both your pre- and postworkout \\nshakes and supplements. For example, if you train \\nfrom 7:00 to 8:30 a.m., then your feeding window \\nstarts at 8:30 a.m. with your postworkout shake \\nand ends at 4:30 p.m. with your bedtime snack of \\nslow-digesting protein. If you train in the morning, \\nyet ending your feeding window in the late afternoon \\nis too early for you, then you could postpone your \\npostworkout shake by 2 to 3 hours. It’s not ideal for \\nmaintaining muscle mass, but it certainly will not \\nTABLE 28.12 Sample Meal Plan When Exercising After \\nDinner (continued)'),\n",

The following sample meal plans \\nin tables 28.13 through 28.16 show you how to \\napply intermittent fasting for the four main training \\ntimes throughout the day. And while I suggest that \\nyou schedule your fasting and eating around the \\ntime you train, you can also adjust the time you \\ntrain to better match when you want to fast and \\neat. If you normally train in the morning but find \\nthat it’s almost impossible for you to fast at night \\nbecause your cravings are stronger at night, then \\ntrain later in the day so that you fast in the morning \\nand eat at night.\\nIntermittent fasting has become increasingly \\npopular in the last few years. However, I have been \\ninterested in its application for fat loss for a couple \\nof decades. The lab where I did my postdoctoral \\nat Yale University School of Medicine did a bit of \\nwork on fasting and fat loss before 2000. Our \\ngroup published several papers showing that one \\nof the key mechanisms in fasting-induced fat loss \\nhas to do with an increase in the activity of genes \\nthat increase the number of calories the body \\nburns (Pilegaard et al. 2003; Hildebrandt et al. \\n2000). More specifically, when you fast, it turns on \\ngenes that encode for certain uncoupling proteins. \\nIn simple terms, these uncoupling proteins poke \\nholes in the mitochondria inside muscle cells. \\nThe mitochondria are where most of your energy \\nis derived from, especially at rest. By poking holes \\nin the mitochondria, they produce less energy. So \\nthey have to burn far more calories to produce the \\nsame amount of energy in the form of ATP .\\nFasting also works through a number of mecha-\\nnisms that lead to increased calorie and fat burn \\nand enhanced fat loss. Research also suggest \\nthat fasting provides numerous health benefits, \\nsuch as lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels \\n(Mattson and Wan 2005).\\nSome proponents claim that IF even benefits \\nmuscle building. But this is where I disagree with \\ntheir logic. There really is no research suggesting \\nthat IF benefits muscle growth over a traditional \\ndiet. In fact, from my personal experience and the \\ndata I’ve collected over the years, it would appear \\nthat IF would limit muscle growth as compared to \\nfollowing the rules covered in chapter 27 for eating \\nto maximize muscle growth.\\nThere is no debating the fact that intermittent \\nfasting works well to enhance fat loss. However, it \\nis not a method of dieting that needs to be used \\nfrom the get-go. Instead, I recommend using it once \\nyou’ve hit a plateau and you can no longer lower \\ncarbohydrate. Since you want to keep protein and \\nfat as high as possible, IF allows you one more step \\nbefore you need to start whittling away at those \\ntwo critical macros to lower calories and continue \\nlosing body fat.\\nThe following sample diets in tables 28.13 \\nthrough 28.16 show how to apply IF based on when \\nyou train. You will still consume the same number \\nof calories, grams of protein, carbohydrate, and fat \\nas you did in the prior phase of the diet. You should \\neven consume the same number of meals. Since \\nyou are cramming so many meals into an 8-hour \\ntime frame, meals will come more frequently than \\nyou were eating, maybe an hour or two apart and \\nas soon as 30 minutes in some cases. If you find \\nthat you cannot consume this many meals, you \\ncan also combine some of them. For example, the \\nsnack before dinner is a protein shake and peanut \\nbutter. You can have this shake with dinner and \\nenjoy the peanut butter as a dessert.\\nWhile you should do your best to consume the \\nsame amount of food as your previous diet phase, \\nit is not the end of the world if you simply cannot. \\nThis is one of the fringe benefits of IF. You often \\ncannot consume that much food in the 8-hour time \\nwindow, which lowers calories and aids fat loss. \\nYet this is also one reason why you should wait \\nuntil a later stage in your diet to employ IF. If you \\nstart it too soon, you may not be able to consume \\nenough food during your feeding window, which will \\nmake it hard to drop calories in later stages as \\nyour fat loss plateaus.\\nAlthough the meals in the sample diets still list \\nbreakfast, lunch, and dinner, these meals may not \\nnecessarily be consumed at the normal time for \\nthat meal. In the sample morning workout, if you \\nfinish your workout at 8:00 a.m. and consume \\nyour postworkout meal at this time, your feeding \\nwindow ends at 4:00 p.m. That means that lunch \\nwill be some time before noon and dinner would \\nprobably be before 3:00 p.m.\\nYou should also continue to include one high-car-\\nbohydrate day each week with IF. You can either \\ndo the high-carb day as an IF day with an 8-hour \\nfeeding window or try eating at any hour of the day \\nto see what works best for you.

However, every body \\nreacts differently. So if you have hit a fat-loss pla-\\nteau with low-carbohydrate IF, then you will need to \\nadjust your diet yet again. As mentioned, once you \\nare down to 0.25 gram of carbohydrate per pound \\nof body weight, it’s fairly impossible to go any lower \\nin carbohydrate without removing vegetables and \\nprotein shakes, which you really do not want to do. \\nThe only thing left to do now is lower the other mac-\\nronutrients—fat and protein. This will bring calories \\ndown again and allow you to burn more body fat.\\nSo you will cut out some protein shakes, such as \\nwith breakfast, and cut out some fat from peanut \\nbutter and by reducing the amount of salad dressing \\nyou use. This will bring protein intake down to about \\n1.25 grams per pound of body weight and fat to \\nabout 0.25 gram per pound of body weight. And cal-\\nories will now be just 9 per pound of body weight, or \\nabout 1,800 calories total for the 200-pound person.\\nOf course, you will also continue to employ \\nintermittent fasting to help with fat loss because \\nyou are reducing calories through less protein and \\nfat. Be sure to add a high-carbohydrate day, but \\nkeep it within the 8-hour feeding window with IF. \\nSee tables 28.17 through 28.20.\\nTABLE 28.17 Sample IF Meal Plan When \\nExercising First Thing in the Morning\\nDuring workout (drink during workout)\\n5-10 grams BCAAs\\n2-5 grams creatine (depending on form)\\n2-3 grams beta-alanine\\nPostworkout (within 30 minutes after workout, which \\nstarts your 8-hour eating window)\\n40-60 grams protein from a mixed protein powder (whey/\\ncasein)\\n5-10 grams BCAAs \\n2-5 grams creatine (depending on form)\\n2-3 grams beta-alanine\\nBreakfast (30 minutes after postworkout meal)\\n3 whole eggs, 3 egg whites, and 1 tbsp olive oil \\n(scrambled eggs cooked in olive oil)\\nLate-morning snack\\n1 cup low-fat cottage cheese\\nLunch\\n6 oz. can albacore tuna (add tuna to salad)\\n2 cups mixed green salad\\n1 tbsp salad dressing (olive oil and vinegar)\\n> continued'),\n",

But, as I \\nhave said earlier, every body is different, and there \\nis always one person who is an outlier and does not \\nrespond as you would expect. So if you have hit a \\nplateau in fat loss and have some more body fat to \\nstrip away, then you would simply continue making \\nsmall reductions in your calories by dropping more \\nfat and protein. You could cut out olive oil completely \\nand use noncaloric cooking spray and just vinegar for \\nsalad dressing. And you could reduce your protein \\nmeals by about a quarter of the serving size. These \\nsmall changes will allow you to keep calories slowly \\ndropping while you continue losing fat.\\nMAINTAINING YOUR NEW \\nLEAN BODY\\nA common question I get from those dieting down \\nto low levels of body fat is how to maintain that \\nlean body without gaining body fat while trying to \\nbuild more muscle. It is quite possible to do so if \\nyou are very careful and detailed with your diet. You \\nsimply can’t go back to the way you were eating \\nbefore you started to get serious with your fat-loss \\ndiet. That will lead to rapid fat gain because your \\nmetabolism is a bit slower at this moment. Just \\nlike reducing carbohydrate and calories was a slow \\nand progressive process, so should be your return \\nto a higher-carb and higher-calorie diet. Simply \\nput, you will reverse the steps that brought you to \\nwhere you now are.\\nYour strategy for gaining muscle but not fat will \\nbe to slowly move to the step before your current \\nstep in the diet process. So if you left off at step \\n7, then you will move into step 6 of the diet. How \\nlong you stay there depends on how your body \\nreacts. I would suggest staying with a diet step \\nno less than two weeks before moving to the \\nnext step. Your body will need time to adjust to \\nthe higher carbohydrate and caloric intake. It will \\nrespond by increasing your metabolic rate, which \\nwill allow you to consume more carbohydrate and \\nmore calories without adding body fat or at least \\nnot adding much body fat. You will likely not be able \\nto maintain the exact amount of body fat that you \\nreached in your final stages of the diet while you \\nare adding carbohydrate and calories. But if you \\ndo it slowly enough, a very minimal amount of fat \\nwill be added.\\nIf you find that you are gaining fat readily when \\nyou move up a step, do some diet cycling. For \\nexample, if you are currently at 0.5 gram of car -\\nbohydrate per pound of body weight and find that \\nmoving up to 0.75 gram of carbohydrate per pound \\nis putting some fat on your physique, then stick \\nwith the 0.5 gram for two days and then doing a \\nday of 0.75 gram and then back to 0.5 gram for \\ntwo days and back to 0.75 gram. Then eventually \\nmove to alternating 0.5 gram and 0.75 gram every \\nday. Then eventually move into consuming 0.75 \\ngram of carbohydrate every day.\\nThe nice thing about maintaining your lean \\nphysique by slowly increasing carbohydrate and \\ncalories is that you can afford to include a real \\ncheat day once per week. So instead of having \\na “clean” high-carb day once a week where fat \\nis relatively low and you are focusing on low-fat \\ncarbohydrate like rice, oatmeal, and popcorn, and \\nyou can also include some “dirty” foods like ice \\ncream, doughnuts, and pizza.'),\n",

This \\ndoes not mean that you should be eating those \\nexact foods and only those foods. When it comes \\nto nutrition, variety is always best. Yet many people \\nworry that eating a different type of meat for dinner \\nor a different kind of fruit will throw off their diets. \\nIn reality, you can replace most foods with similar \\nyet different foods without having it affect your \\nmacronutrient and calorie totals much, if at all.\\nThe key to using these diets as templates but \\nreplacing the foods with different selections is to \\nchoose foods that are of a similar kind and size. For \\nexample, if you don’t have 8 ounces of top sirloin \\nsteak, you can replace it with 8 ounces of chicken \\nor other poultry, fish, or lean pork. If you want to \\nreplace a medium apple, you can choose a medium \\npeach or orange or pear. One cup of chopped broc-\\ncoli can be replaced with one cup of green beans \\nor chopped zucchini or chopped asparagus.\\nRefer to the following list of food alternatives so \\nthat your diet doesn’t become boring and lacking \\nin nutrient diversity.\\nMEAT REPLACEMENTS\\nThe following meats can be used for any meal with \\nthe sample diet.

Dairy \\nprovides a good blend of whey and casein protein, \\nwhich have been shown to be superior for muscle \\ngrowth.

These terms include \\nboth formal nomenclature and slang terms that have \\nbeen established by the community. To better under -\\nstand the language used in the chapters of this book \\nas well as in the gym, consider the following terms. This \\ncollection of terms is not exhaustive; it includes only \\nthe definitions that are not found elsewhere in the book \\nor those that need a clearer explanation.\\nabduction—Movement away from the body such as what \\noccurs when you raise your arm straight out to the side.\\nabs—A slang term referring to the abdominal muscles.\\nadduction—Movement of a limb toward the body such as \\nwhat occurs when your arm is straight out to your side \\nand you lower it down to the side of your body.\\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP)—The molecular “currency” \\nthat provides energy in cells for everything from protein \\nsynthesis to muscle contraction.\\nadipose tissue—Where fat is stored in the body.\\nadvanced weightlifter—A person who has strength-trained \\nsteadily and systematically for at least one full year.\\naerobic exercise—Prolonged (usually performed for at least \\n20 minutes continuously), moderate-intensity exercise \\nthat uses up oxygen at or below the level at which the \\ncardiorespiratory system can replenish oxygen in the \\nworking muscles. Common aerobic exercise activities are \\nwalking, jogging, running, cycling, stair climbing, working \\nout on elliptical exercise machines, rowing, swimming, \\ndancing, and aerobic dance classes.\\nagonist muscle —A muscle responsible for producing a \\nspecific movement through concentric muscle action. \\nFor example, during the biceps curl exercise, the biceps \\nmuscle is the agonist muscle.\\nanaerobic exercise —Exercise that is higher in intensity \\nthan aerobic work. Anaerobic exercise uses up oxygen \\nmore quickly than the body can replenish it in the work-\\ning muscles. Anaerobic exercise uses stored-muscle \\nATP , phosphocreatine, and glycogen to supply its energy \\nneeds. Common anaerobic activities are weightlifting \\nand sprinting.\\nantagonist muscle—The muscle responsible for actively \\nopposing the concentric muscle action of the agonist \\nmuscle. Although this seems counterintuitive, the \\nopposing force is necessary for joint stability during the \\nmovement. For example, during the biceps curl exercise, \\nthe triceps muscle is the antagonist muscle.\\nanterior—Anatomical term referring to the front of the body.\\nassistance exercise—Typically single-joint exercises such \\nas the biceps curl, triceps extension, and deltoid lateral \\nraise. These exercises involve only a single muscle group.\\nATP—See adenosine triphosphate.\\natrophy—Wasting away of any part, organ, tissue, or cell, \\nsuch as the atrophy of muscle fibers caused by inactivity.\\nballistic stretch —This type of muscle stretch involves \\ndynamic muscle action in which the muscles are \\nstretched suddenly in a bouncing movement. A ballistic \\nstretch for the hamstrings might involve touching your \\ntoes repeatedly in rapid succession.\\nbasal metabolic rate—The rate at which the body burns \\ncalories while awake but at rest (usually measured in \\ncalories per day).\\nbeginning weightlifter—A person with less than six months \\nof strength training experience.\\nbelt—See weight belt.\\nbis—A slang term for the biceps muscles.\\nBMR—See basal metabolic rate.\\nbodybuilding—A type of strength training applied in con -\\njunction with nutritional practices to alter the shape of \\nthe body’s musculature. The sport of bodybuilding is a \\ncompetitive sport in amateur and professional categories \\nfor males and females.\\nbody fat percentage —The amount of fat in your body, \\ngenerally expressed as a percentage.\\nbulking up—To gain body size and mass, preferably muscle \\ntissue.\\nburn—A slang term for the intense and painful sensation \\nfelt in a muscle that has been fatigued by high-rep sets.\\ncardio—See aerobic exercise.\\nchalk—Also known as magnesium carbonate, it is often \\nused by powerlifters and Olympic lifters to keep the hands \\ndry for a more secure grip on the weights.\\ncheating—The condition in which strict form is ignored in \\norder to get a few additional reps out of a set. Cheating \\nis not generally recommended because it can lead to \\ninjury. However, it can sometimes help a lifter push the \\nmuscles beyond muscle failure. An example of cheating \\nwould be forcibly swinging the upper body to help com-\\nplete a standing biceps curl.\\ncompound exercise—An exercise that involves more than one \\nmuscle group to perform the exercise. Therefore, movement \\noccurs at more than one joint. For this reason, compound \\nexercises are often called multijoint exercise. These types \\nof exercises are the best choices for developing strength. \\nExamples are the squat, bench press, and barbell row.'),\n",

An exam-\\nple is the grip used for the reverse barbell curl or shrug.\\noverreaching—Scientific term used to describe exercise \\ntraining that pushes the body beyond its limits to recover \\nand adapt. This usually involves training with too much \\nvolume, too much intensity, too much frequency, or all \\nof these. Overreaching is the stage that occurs just \\nbefore the athlete becomes overtrained. If an athlete \\nstops overreaching in time, the athlete can avoid the \\ndeleterious effects of overtraining and actually rebound \\nwith rapid advances in strength and muscle mass.\\novertraining—When an athlete overreaches for too long, \\nhe or she reaches the point of overtraining. Chronically \\nexceeding the body’s ability to recover by overreaching \\ncauses the body to stop progressing and actually lose \\nsome of the gains that were made in strength and \\nmuscle mass. Besides impairing athletic performance, \\novertraining can increase the risk of injury or disease. \\nThe early signs of overtraining from too much weight \\ninclude increased resting heart rate, difficulty in sleeping, \\nincreased sweating, and altered emotions. The early \\nsigns of overtraining from lifting too much volume or \\ntoo often include decreased resting heart rate, digestion \\nproblems, fatigue, and lower blood pressure.\\npassive stretching—This type of stretching involves having \\na partner assist in moving joints through their ranges of \\nmotion. This allows for a greater range of motion than \\nwhat can be reached when stretching alone.\\npeak—The absolute zenith of competitive condition \\nachieved by an athlete.\\npecs—A slang term that refers to the pectoralis muscles.\\nperiodization—The systematic manipulation of the acute \\nvariables of training over a period that may range from \\ndays to years.\\nphosphocreatine (PCr) —An energy-rich compound that \\nplays a critical role in providing energy for muscle action \\nby maintaining ATP concentration.\\nplantar flexion —Moving the top of the foot away from \\nthe shin, such as when pointing the toes down for heel \\nraises.\\npositive phase of repetition—The concentric portion of the \\nrepetition. Examples of the positive phase include the \\npressing of the barbell off the chest during the bench \\npress and the curling up of the weight during a barbell curl.\\npowerlifting—A form of competitive weightlifting that fea-\\ntures three lifts: the squat, bench press, and deadlift. \\nPowerlifting is contested both nationally and interna -\\ntionally in a variety of weight and age classes for both \\nmen and women.\\npreexhaust —The use of single-joint exercises before \\nmultijoint exercises in an effort to exhaust a particular \\nmuscle group so that it becomes the weak link in the \\nmultijoint exercise.\\nprimary exercise —An exercise that is most specific to \\nthe goals of the lifter. These exercises must involve the \\nmuscle groups in which the person is most interested \\nin gaining strength.\\npronation—Rotating the wrist inward.\\nprone—Lying horizontally on the abdomen.\\npump—A term commonly used by bodybuilders to refer to \\nthe swelling that muscles undergo during a workout. The \\npump occurs because when muscles contract repeatedly \\nthey create metabolic waste products that draw water \\ninto the muscle. The greater water volume increases \\nthe overall size of the muscle cells. This can lead to \\ntemporary increases in total muscle size of one to two \\ninches. The pump typically lasts until the metabolic \\nwaste products have been cleared from the muscle.\\nquads—A slang term referring to the quadriceps muscles \\non the front thigh.\\nrange of motion (ROM)—The range through which a joint \\ncan be moved, usually its range of flexion and extension. \\nExercises also have a specific range of motion that \\ninvolves the movement from start to finish.\\nrep—Slang term for repetition.\\nrepetition—Refers to a single execution of an exercise. For \\nexample, if you curl a barbell through the entire range \\nof motion once from start to finish, you have completed \\none repetition (rep) of the movement.\\nrepetition speed—The length of time it takes to complete \\none rep.\\nresistance—The amount of weight used in an exercise. \\nSometimes referred to as intensity.\\nresting metabolic rate (RMR) —The metabolic rate mea -\\nsured under conditions of rest. This is the minimal \\nnumber of calories a person will need during a day to \\nmaintain body weight.\\nrest interval—The brief pause lasting between 30 seconds \\nand 2 minutes, and in some cases even longer, which \\noccurs between sets to allow the body to partially recu-\\nperate before initiating the succeeding set.\\nripped—A term that means a body has clearly visible \\nmuscles and very little fat.\\nroutine —A term that refers to an individual training \\nprogram.\\nRMR—See resting metabolic rate.\\nset—A group of consecutive repetitions of an exercise that \\nare performed without resting.\\nsingle-joint exercise—See isolation exercise.\\nsix-pack—A slang term used to refer to defined abdomi -\\nnal muscles. The term is used because most people’s \\nabdominal muscles create six bulges (three per side) \\nwhen they are well developed and body fat levels are low.\\nslow-twitch muscle fiber—A type of muscle fiber that has \\nhigh endurance capacity and poor ability to generate \\nquick, powerful contractions.'),\n",

The most basic split \\nroutine is done four days per week. The most popular \\ntype of split routine involves dividing the body into three \\nparts, which are worked over three consecutive days, \\nfollowed by a rest day and a repeat of the routine on day \\nfive. This is called a three-on and one-off split.\\nspotter—A training partner or a person who gives assis -\\ntance to a lifter while the lifter is performing an exercise. \\nThe purpose of the spotter is to be on hand in case the \\nlifter fails to complete a rep. In this case, the spotter \\ncan help the lifter complete the rep, which allows the \\nlifter to train past muscle failure as well as avoid injury \\non dangerous exercises such as the bench press.\\nstabilizer muscles—Muscles that assist in the performance \\nof an exercise by steadying the joint or limb being moved \\nbut not increasing the force applied to move the weight.\\nstaggered grip—A grip in which the left and right hand have \\nopposite styles of grip. One hand uses an underhand grip \\nwhile the other uses an overhand grip. This is a common \\ngrip used during the deadlift because the alternated \\ngripping allows for stronger grip strength.\\nstatic stretch—A low-force, long-duration stretch that holds \\nthe desired muscle at the greatest possible length for \\n20 to 30 seconds.\\nsticking point—The point in an exercise where the muscle \\nis at its weakest.\\nstriations—Fine grooves or bands on the surface of a \\nmuscle. The grooves are caused by the molecular \\nmachinery of the muscle fibers that are visible through \\nthe skin in ripped bodybuilders.\\nsupination—Rotating the wrist outward.\\nsupine—Lying horizontally on the back.\\nsynergist—A muscle that assists in the performance of an \\nexercise by adding to the force required for executing \\nthe movement. For example, the triceps muscle is a \\nsynergist to the pectoralis muscles during the bench \\npress exercise.\\ntendon—A band of dense white fibrous tissue that con -\\nnects a muscle to a bone. The movement of the bone is \\nproduced by the transmission of force from the muscle \\nthrough the tendon to the bone.\\ntestosterone—The primary natural androgenic and ana -\\nbolic steroid hormone produced primarily by the testes \\nin the male. It is also produced in smaller quantities by \\nthe adrenal glands in both males and females. Testos-\\nterone is the hormone responsible for maintenance of \\nmuscle mass and strength as well as the development \\nof secondary male sexual characteristics such as a deep \\nvoice, body and facial hair, and male pattern baldness.\\ntraining log—A log that a lifter keeps for recording work -\\nouts. The information recorded usually includes exer -\\ncises performed, weight used, number of sets performed, \\nnumber of reps completed per set, amount of rest taken \\nbetween sets, how the lifter felt during or after exercises, \\nand what the lifter ate before and after the workout. This \\ninformation helps the lifter assess progress and stay \\nmotivated to reach goals.\\ntraining partner —A person who trains with you on the \\nmajority of your training days.\\ntraps—A slang term for the trapezius muscles.\\ntris—A slang term referring to the triceps muscles.\\nunderhand grip—The opposite of an overhand grip. The \\nlifter should grip the barbell or dumbbell with the hands \\nunder the bar.\\nvascularity—The visibility of veins through the skin.\\nvolume training—The use of a very high number sets for \\neach bodypart.\\nwarm-up—Before any workout it is important to gradually \\nprepare the body through low-intensity exercise. This \\nhelps to get the heart rate elevated so that oxygen \\nuptake and blood flow to muscle tissue are enhanced. \\nIt also increases body temperature, which enhances the \\nmobility of joints and the contractibility of muscle fibers. \\nGood warm-up exercises include walking on a treadmill, \\nriding a stationary cycle, doing light calisthenics, and \\ndoing lightweight lifting slowly and rhythmically.\\nwashboard abs—a slang term used to describe ripped abs.\\nweight belt—A wide belt usually made of leather or nylon \\nthat is worn tightly around the waist to help support \\nthe low back and increase abdominal pressure. This \\nis supposed to help prevent back injury and increase \\nstrength. Today it is recommended that belts be worn \\nonly during exercise training in which near-maximal \\nweights are being lifted.\\nweightlifting gloves—Gloves made of leather or synthetic \\nmaterials are often worn during weightlifting to aid in the \\ngrip and prevent calluses from developing on the palms.\\nworking set—The set performed after finishing the warm-up \\nsets.\\nworkout—A single training session.\\nwrist straps—Strips of material (often canvas, nylon, or \\nleather) that are about 2 inches (5 centimeters) wide and \\n12 inches (30.5 centimeters) long with a looped end. \\nThey are wrapped around the wrist and the bar or handle \\nthat the lifter is holding onto to increase grip strength.\\nwrist wraps —Bands of elastic material that are tightly \\nwrapped around the wrists to support them during heavy \\nlifting or while performing exercises that place a high \\namount of stress on the wrists.'),\n",
